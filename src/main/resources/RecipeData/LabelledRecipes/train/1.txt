  mixture by teaspoonfuls onto the pecans.  As the clusters cool,
  remove with a metal spatula to another waxed-paper lined baking
  sheet.  Push the remaining pecans together and repeat until all of
  the candy mixture is used. If the mixture becomes too thick, heat
  over low heat.  Melt the chocolate chips over hot water and stir
  until smooth.  Spread on the top of each pecan cluster.  Let stand
  until the chocolate is set and store the candies in a cool place.
  Makes about 4 dozen.

 Categories: Cakes, Texas, Desserts, Sauces
      Yield: 10 servings
      2    9-inch layers of choc. Cake
      1    Caramel Sauce (Recipe)
      2 c  Heavy Cream
    1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      2 ts Butter
    1/3 c  Heavy Cream
      1    Fudge Icing (Recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate
      1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
    1/8 ts Salt
  FOR CAKE:
     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel
  Sauce and Cashews.  Repeat with next 2 cake layers.  Place final cake
  layer on top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover
  sides of cake with chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil.
  Stir in chocolate until melted and smooth. This will be very soft but
  will harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable consistency.
  NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable consistency depends on
  the weather. This is much like making fudge candy. The author,
  (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and had no
  problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and reduce
  to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add
  cream.  Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny

      Title: Brown Sugar Fudge (Penuche)
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
      1 c  White Sugar; Granulated
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream
      2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate; 2 Sqs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar; Firm Pack
      3 tb Molasses; *
      4 tb Butter; 1/2 stick
    1/2 c  Chopped Nuts; Optional
  *    This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 Tbls of
  Molasses, STEP 1:  PREPARE: Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use
  a 2-quart saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan;
  measure all ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump
  into the saucepan. Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.
  Fill glass with ice cubes and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of
  cold water. STEP 2: Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon, over low heat until the butter melts, the gritty sounds
  cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over the bottom of the pan.
  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. STEP 3: Boil, after
  washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a pastry brush
  dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little water
  as possible. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer. Reduce the heat
  while keeping the fudge at a boil. Stir no more than necessary. STEP
  4: Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture
  thickens and bubbles become noisy.  Ball, formed in ice water, should
  hold its shape until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and
  should be al dente ~- slightly chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110 and
  115.5 degrees C.). Because of the molasses and brown sugar, it can
  ball at a lower temperature than some other fudges. STEP 5: Shock by
  placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink. STEP 6: Seed by
  adding, without stirring, the vanilla. Then allow to cool. STEP 7:
  Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110 degrees F.(43.5
  degrees C.)). Return the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak
  clean. Stir the fudge thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an
  electric mixer, or with a food processor. Pause frequently to allow
  the fudge to react. STEP 8: Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its
  sheen, and become lighter in color or streaked with lighter shade,
  give off some heat, suddenly stiffen. If mixing by had, the fudge
  will "snap" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer waves will become very
  distinct, by food processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to the
  center when the processor is stopped. STEP 9: Add the optionals (1/2
  Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts (filberts)) before
  the fudge totally candies. STEP 10: Pour, score, and store when cool
  in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room temperature.
  YIELD: 1 pound of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be frozen.
  VARIATIONS: HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate the
  unsweetened chocolate and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey.
  The honey causes the fudge to ball at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE
  HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with
  light cream or evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup
  of honey. ORANGE BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate molasses,
  chocolate but add 1 Tbl corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 Tbl grated
  orange zest, plus if you can get it, 1 tsp of pure orange extract.
  PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eliminate the molasses
  and chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4
  cup of creamy peanut butter. To intensify the peanut butter flavor,
  add 1/3 of a cup of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is optional -- you'ss get
  a more Southern praline with it, a milder one without it--or
  compromise and use only 1 Tbls.  Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3,
  when the mixture begins to thicken, add 1 1/2 cups of pecan halves
  slowly so as not to break the boil or cool the mixture too quickly.

  banned. While I have not tried this recipe, I did make the other one
  and it was good. But the other recipe is long gone.

  in hot water.  Cool slightly.  Combine chocolate, cream cheese, milk,
  confectioners' sugar, salt, and vanilla in a bowl.  Beat with an
  electric mixer at high speed until smooth and creamy. NOTE: This is
  one of those dishes that sound absolutely horrible, but tastes great.
  It is also one of those recipes that is a classic but you can never
  find in most cookbooks.  I have fooled my kids with this as well as
  seen it done on TV.  Everyone thinks that the sauerkraut is coconut.
  So be sure to rinse and drain the sauerkraut several times when you
  make this recipe.

    1/4 c  Vegetable Shorteneing
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
      1 c  ;Water
--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
      3 c  Confectioners' sugar
      3 oz Baking Chocolate
  Sift togetehr the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
  into a large mixing bowl.  Add shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs,
  water and chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric
  mixer at low speed, scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2 minute.
  Increase speed to high and beat an additional 3 minutes, scraping
  bowl occasionally.  Pour batter into 2 greased and waxed-paper lined
  9-inch round cake pans.  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. Oven for
  35 minutes or until cake tests done.  Cool in pans on racks for 10
  minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on the racks.  Place
  one cake layer on serving plate.  Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate
  Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides and top of the
  cake with the remaining Sour Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR
  CREAM/CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine,
  confectioners' sugar, and sour cream in a mixing bowl; blend well.
  Add chocolate which has been melted and cooled and vanilla. Beat
  until smooth. NOTE: I have seen reference to people having trouble
  with their layer cakes and how they rise. Try this little trick when
  making this cake. Take the layer that has the least amount of rise on
  the top and trim it to be flat with a sharp knife.  Place the trimmed
  side down (layer should be upside down).  Then frost between layers
  and place the other layer on right side up and finished frosting.  It
  will give the illusion of having a cake with only one domed layer and
  will sit better on your cake plate.  Also the trimmings are great
  eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

  to spread. DO NOT overbeat or you will have butter instead of whipped
  cream. NOTE: The original recipe came from a GI who found it in Egypt
  when he was stationed there.  Hence the name.  The whipped cream
  frosting was added later but really adds to the recipe.

      Title: CHAMPAGNE TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candies, Kump
      Yield: 24 servings
-----------------------CENTER MIXTURE----------------------------
      8 oz Cream
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Cognac
--------------------------ENROBING-------------------------------
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 lb Cocoa
  It is important to use an excellent quality chocolate when making
  truffles since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first
  choice and Callebaut is my second.
  BRING THE CREAM TO A BOIL and pour it over the cut chocolate. Allow to
  stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir smooth. Beat in the softened butter and
  cool to set. Beat with an electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if
  available) on medium speed until light. Beat in Cognac. Pipe out small
  truffles on parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/2-inch plain tube. Refrigerate to set. Melt the chocolate. Sift the
  cocoa into a deep pan. Dip the truffles in the melted chocolate and
  then deposit them in the cocoa, shaking the pan to cover them. After
  the covering sets, shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the
  excess cocoa.

 Categories: Fruits, Desserts, Candies, Madison
      Yield: 1 servings
      3    Plump, pink grapefruit,
           - preferably organic
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
           Superfine sugar; for coating
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 tb Butter
  SCORE GRAPEFRUIT INTO QUARTERS and carefully pull off peels or juice
  fruits and cut halves again in half. Place peels in large pan, cover
  them with cold water and bring to boil. Simmer 25 minutes. Remove
  peels and let them cool until they are easy to handle. Hold peels
  firmly against counter and gently scrape away most of white pith just
  below skin. Cut cleaned peels into strips with knife or scissors as
  narrow or wide as you like. In 2-quart saucepan, mix together sugar,
  water and corn syrup. Bring to boil. When syrup is clear, add peels,
  lower heat and cook slowly until peels are translucent, about 1 hour.
  Set cake rack over baking sheet. Remove peels a few at a time and
  spread them out on rack to drain about 15 minutes. While they are
  draining, thickly cover large plate with super- fine sugar. Set
  several pieces at a time in sugar and turn them to coat them. When
  evenly coated, set them aside on another plate or piece of parchment
  paper thinly coated with sugar. This process will need to be done in
  several batches. If sugar become lumpy with beads of syrup, pass it
  through a strainer, then continue using it. Set aside sugared peels
  about 1 hour or until they are dried. Carefully package them in tin
  or plastic container and store either in cupboard or refrigerator. To
  dip peels in chocolate, melt semisweet chocolate over simmering water
  along with butter. Stir well to ensure that mixture is smooth before
  removing from heat. Dip each rind into chocolate, coating most of it
  but leaving a little "handle" to grasp. Or, completely immerse each
  rind in chocolate, then remove with 2 forks or pair of chopsticks.
  Set slices on parchment paper or cake rack and place in cool place to
  harden. Once chocolate has set, pieces can be stored in refrigerator.
  Chocolate will discolor when it cools but will become dark and glossy
  again once brought to room temperature.

      Title: Chocolate Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme
 Categories: Cajun, Candies
      Yield: 24 servings
  1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Packed, light brown sugar
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
      2 c  Whole pecan halves
      2 tb Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
  NOTE: Chocolate chips should be chilled.
     Assemble all the ingredients and utensils before starting to cook.
  (Measure out the chocolate chips and keep them refregerated until just
  before needed.)  You will need a large, heavy-bottomed aluminum pot or
  skillet with deep sides, a long-handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large
  spoons (or an ice cream scoop with a manual release) and a very
  lightly greased cookie sheet. Melt the butter in the pot over high
  heat; add the sugars, milk, cream and chopped pecans.  cook 5
  minutes, whisking constantly.  reduce heat to medium, and continue
  cooking and whisking 10 minutes.
   Add the pecan halves and continue whisking and cooking until done,
  about 8 to 10 minutes.  (If the mixture smokes excessively toward end
  of cooking time, lower thge heat.) Stir in vanilla. then immediately
  drop about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into about one-sixth of the
  batter. Stir quickly and just enough to cover some of the chips with
  batter but not nenough to allow the chips to melt.  Quickly drop the
  chocolate mixture onto the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using
  the second spoon to push the batter off the first (or use ice cream
  scoop); each praline should be about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2
  inch thick. repeat with remaining mixture, stirring briefly before
  adding more chocolate chips.  The cooled pralines should be light
  brown, opaque, somewhat chunky and crumbly. LAGNIAPPE: To clean the
  pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with the utensils in it. This
  will melt the batter off. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen.

      1 pk Brownie mix
      2 tb Water
      3    Eggs
----------------------CHOCOLATE GLAZE---------------------------
    1/2 lb Semi-sweet chocolate
    1/3 c  Water
  Melt the chocolate with the coffee in the top of a double boiler.
  When the chocolate is completely melted, remove the pan from the
  heat. Beat the egg yolks until pale yellow and stir into the
  chocolate. Gradually stir in the Tia Maria. Cool the mixture. In a
  separate bowl, beat the egg whites gradually adding the sugar, until
  the whites are stiff. Whip the cream. Gently fold the whipped cream
  into the cooled chocolate mixture and then fold in the whites.
   CAKE: Beat ingredients together at medium speed of electric mixer
  until batter is smooth. Grease a 11x15" jelly roll pan. Line it with
  waxed paper. Grease and flour the paper, shaking off any excess
  flour. Spread the batter evenly in the jelly roll pan. Bake for 10-12
  minutes or until the cake tests done. Turn the cake on a rack and
  peel off the paper. Lightly oil a charlotte mold and line with the
  cooled cake. Cut the rounds of cake to fit both the top and the
  bottom of the moldm, and a strip for the sides. Place the smaller
  round in the bottom of the mold. Wrap the strip around the inside of
  the mold. You will probably have to piece one section of the side to

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 48 servings
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose
      1 c  Fruit sugar
    1/2 lb Belgian chocolate
      1 lb Butter, soft
      1 c  Sifted rice flour
  Spread the all-purpose flour on a cookie sheet and place under a
  pre-heated broiler about 4-5 inches from the element.  Roast the
  flour, watching it all the time until it is medium brown.  Turn the
  flour with a spatula to brown the other side.  The entire procedure
  takes about three minutes and gives the flour a rich nutty flavour.
  Let the flour cool.
  Mix the soft butter with the fruit sugar and add the sifted rice
  flour. Fold in the roasted flour and blend well.  Chop the chocolate
  into chunks just a little smaller than a sugar cube.  Mix them into
  the dough, taking care you don't soften the chocolate too much.

  airtight container.  Yield depends upon size and shape.
      Title: Brownie Cookies
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies, Chocolate
      Yield: 48 servings
      4 oz Semisweet chocolate
  2 1/3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      2    Egg
    3/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      1 tb Milk
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. 2.  Sift the flour, baking
  soda, and baking powder together. Set aside. 3.  In the bowl of a
  mixer, cream the butter. Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat.
  Add the vanilla, then the eggs 1 at a time. Add the chocolate and
  stir to blend. 4. Stir in the dry ingredients and the milk by hand.
  When just blended, mix in the walnuts. Cover and refrigerate dough
  for 30 minutes before rolling. 5. Preheat oven to 375 degres. Lightly
  grease a cookie sheet. 6. To form the cookies, scoop out a portion of
  dough and roll out on a well-floured surface. When dough is 1/4 inch
  thick, cut it into rounds or other desired shapes. Re-roll scraps and
  cut again. 7. Place on cookie sheet (leave room for expansion) and
  bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch for any hot spots in the oven and
  don't let these cookies overbrown. VARIATION: For the Brownie Cookie
  Crust, make 1 recipe of Brownie Cookies and chill the dough briefly.
  Lightly grease the back side of a large baking sheet. Roll the dough
  out onto the baking sheet as thinly as possible so that the baked
  product will crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7
  minutes. Let crust harden, then slide the cookie from the sheet and
  cool completely. Roll over the cookie with a rolling pin until it is
  crushed to a fine crumb. (There should be about 2 1/4 cups of
  crumbs.) Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Mix it
  into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the bottom and up the sides
  of a 10-inch springform pan. Freeze for 30 minutes before filling in
  order to set the crust. Note: When I made this, I made individual
  cookie crumb crusts for the "Kit's Chocolate Mousse" recipe by using
  a large muffin pan. Line each cup with waxed paper for easy removal.

---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  3 1/3 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
     12 tb Lard or butter
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Milk
------------------EGG WASH FOR ASSEMBLING-----------------------
      1    Egg
      1 pn Salt
           Confectioners' sugar
  The name of these filled pastries is Cucidati, which is Sicilian for
  Buccellati, or "little bracelets."
  FOR THE FILLING: Stem the figs and quarter them. Place in a bowl and
  cover with boiling water; steep 10 minutes. Drain and chop coarsely
  in the food processor. Combine with remaining ingredients. To prepare
  in advance, cover tightly with plastic wrap and keep at a cool room
  temperature or in the refrigerator up to 3 days.
  FOR THE DOUGH: Combine the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl
  and stir to mix. Rub in the lard or butter finely, leaving the
  mixture powdery. Beat the eggs and milk to combine in a small bowl
  and stir into the flour mixture to form a dough. Turn the dough out
  on a lightly floured surface and knead lightly a few times. Wrap the
  dough in plastic and chill. Divide the dough into 12 pieces and roll
  each into a cylinder about 12 inches long. Flour the surface and the
  dough lightly and roll it into a rectangle about 14 inches long and 3
  inches wide. Place a line of the filling down the center of each
  rectangle, using 1/12 of the filling for each piece of dough. Bring
  up the dough around the filling and pinch to seal. Turn the filled
  sausage of dough over so that the seam is on the bottom and cut it
  into 3 1/2- to 4-inch lengths. Using a sharp paring knife or
  single-edge razor blade, make a series of diagonal slashes in the top
  of each little sausage. Pull and twist gently, holding the sausage at
  each end to open the slashes. Transfer the Cucidati as they are
  formed to paper- lined cookie sheets, curving them into wide
  horseshoe shapes. Make an egg wash by beating the egg and salt
  together with a fork until it is loose. Paint each shape with the egg
  wash. Bake the Cucidati in a preheated 350F oven about 20 minutes, or
  until they are a light golden color. Cool, dust with confectioners'
  sugar and store the Cucidati in tins, between layers of wax paper.

      2 ts Vanilla extract
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      2 c  Semisweet chocolate
      2 c  Milk chocolate
      2 c  Butterscotch bits
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Line an 8 3/4-by-13 1/2-inch glass or metal pan
  with a large piece of aluminum foil, smoothing it into the corners.
  Butter the foil. In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar
  together until it is light in color. Stir in the melted chocolate.
  Add the vanilla, then add the eggs, beating until blended. In another
  bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the walnuts and all the bits,
  tossing to coat them with the flour. Scrape the flour, nuts and bits
  into the bowl with the butter, and stir with a wooden spoon just
  until all the ingredients are mixed. Do not over-beat. Scrape the
  batter into the prepared pan, holding the foil so that it does not
  move. Place the pan in the middle of the oven and bake until a
  toothpick inserted in the center comes out almost clean, about 50
  minutes. Remove the pan and let it stand for an hour, then cover the
  pan with foil and place it in your freezer for at least 1 1/2 hours
  or in your refrigerator overnight. Turn the cooled brownies out onto
  a clean workspace, lift off the foil and cut into 32 squares. Store
  in the refrigerator or the freezer in an airtight tin.

  is chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter
  or flavorings.

      2 tb Creme de cacao
      2 c  Heavy cream; well chilled
      2 tb Confectioner's sugar
      1 tb Vanilla extract
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool until only warm. 2.
   While the chocolate cools, whip the cream until it forms medium-stiff
  peaks. Do not overbeat or the mousse will lose some of its smooth,
  light texture. 3.  Separate 4 of the eggs and set the whites aside.
  Combine yolks with the 2 remaining whole eggs in the bowl of an
  electric mixer. Beat until eggs are thick and lemon colored, around 5
  minutes. While the yolks are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a
  clean copper or stainless steel bowl and whisk, preferably by hand,
  until the whites start to stiffen. Sprinkle on the confectioners'
  sugar and beat until you have firm peaks. 4. Working quickly, add the
  cooled melted chocolate and a scoop of the whipped cream to the egg
  yolks. Stir until smooth, then add the remaining cream. When it is
  fully incorporated, add the liqueur and vanilla, then fold in the
  whites until just blended. 5. This mousse can be poured into small
  individual serving dishes or into 1 larger dessert dish. Chill at
  least 4 hours before serving. (Chilling it overnight intensifies the
  flavor.) The mousse may be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from the
  freezer and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight before serving.

           - (to garnish)
  Couscous is normally a savory dish found in Morocco. This unusual
  dessert version is the specialty of a small convent in Sicily.
  FIRST PREPARE THE PAN for steaming the couscous: For the sealing
  dough, mix the flour and water together in a bowl and scrape onto a
  floured work surface. Knead briefly to form a rough, sticky dough,
  adding a tablespoon or 2 of flour if necessary. Roll into a rope as
  long as the circumference of the bottom pan and apply the dough to
  the rim of the pan. Add water to the pan so that the water is below
  the bottom of the couscousiere or colander and press the couscousiere
  into place. Bring the water to a boil on high heat, until steam is
  escaping freely through the perforations, then lower to a simmer, so
  that the steam escapes very gently. While the water is coming to a
  boil, prepare the couscous to be cooked: Place the grain in a bowl
  and add the water. Swish the water through the grain with the fingers
  of one hand splayed apart, "raking" through it. Tilt the bowl and
  drain away excess water. Set aside for 5 minutes. Line the
  couscousiere with a dampened napkin or cheesecloth and add the grain.
  Cover and steam 15 minutes. While the grain is cooking, prepare the
  flavoring. Half fill a saucepan with water and add the pistachios.
  Bring to a boil; drain in a strainer. Pour the pistachios onto a
  towel, fold the towel over them and rub to loosen skins. Separate
  pistachios from skins, going over them carefully. Combine the freshly
  blanched pistachios, extract and cinnamon in a food processor bowl
  and process for 2-3 minutes, until very finely ground and starting to
  become pasty. Add the oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue
  processing mixture to a smooth paste, stopping the machine and
  scraping the inside of the bowl 3-or-4 times. Reserve pistachio
  paste. After the couscous has steamed 15 minutes, remove it from the
  couscousiere in the cheesecloth and put it in a large, non-reactive
  roasting pan. Spread it out with a fork and let cool. Combine the
  salt and water and work it into the cooled couscous, raking it
  through with 1 hand. Add the pistachio paste in 3-or-4 additions,
  working it in by rubbing it and the couscous together with the
  fingertips. Return the water in the bottom pan to a simmer, and line
  the couscousiere again with the dampened cheesecloth. Add the
  seasoned couscous to the couscousiere, cover and steam 15 minutes.
  Remove the couscous to the roasting pan, spread out with a fork,
  without compressing the mixture, and leave uncovered until cool. To
  finish the couscous, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring to
  dissolve all sugar granules, and cool the syrup. Work the cooled
  couscous between the palms of the hands again to separate the grains
  and toss in the syrup in 5-or-6 additions, fluffing the couscous with
  a fork. Allow the couscous to dry uncovered, several hours, in a cool
  place, fluffing it with a fork occasionally, until all the grains are
  separate. For advance preparation, cover tightly with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate up to several days. To serve, fluff up with a fork so
  the grains separate well and mound the couscous on a platter.
  Sprinkle the couscous evenly with the grated chocolate, then the
  confectioners' sugar. Decorate with no more than 5-or-6 pieces of the
  candied fruit.

      Yield: 24 servings
           -Eileen Shaughnessy-XSPC52B
      2 c  Milk
  1 3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Half & Half
      1 tb Vanilla Extract
      4 c  Whipping Cream
           Pillsbury Chocolate Chip
           Cookie Dough (large size)
           Or use homemade cookie dough
  Take the chocolate cookie dough out of fridge and leave out till
  needed. Scald milk until bubbles form around edge. Remove from heat.
  Add sugar and salt. Stir until dissolved. Stir in half and half,
  vanilla, and whipping cream. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Freeze
  as directed by your ice cream machine's instructions. Once ice cream
  has been through the entire ice cream machine process and is now a
  chilled soft ice cream, add the chocolate chip cookie dough. Just
  break up the dough as best you can with your hands and drop it in
  small clusters into the soft ice cream. Try to mix it around to
  ensure that the cookie dough is evenly distributed throughout the ice
  cream. Put the ice cream in the freezer for several hours until
  hardened. Origin: We pretty much took our vanilla ice cream recipe
  and added the chocolate chip cookie dough. You can easily use the
  Pillsbury cookie dough, but it's cheaper and better to use homemade.
  Our Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough recipe makes this
  especially yummy! -----

      Title: THE FIVE MINUTE KILLER FUDGE
 Categories: Candy, Chocolate
      Yield: 16 servings
    2/3 c  Evaporated Milk
  1 2/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Miniature Marshmallows
  1 1/2 c  Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Nuts
  Read all of the instructions before starting.  Wise advice would be
  to have the ingredients in the 3rd paragraph ready to go, and also
  the pan already buttered.  Do all of this BEFORE you begin to cook.
  Combine Milk, Sugar, and Salt in saucepan over medium heat Bring to a
  boil and cook 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly (start timing when the
  mixture starts to "bubble" around the corners of the pan). Remove
  from heat. Add Marshmallows, Chocolate Chips, Nuts and Vanilla. Stir
  vigorously for 1 minute (or until Marshmallows are completely melted
  and blended).
  Pour into a buttered 8" square pan.  Cool until it doesn't fall out or
  slosh around in pan.  Eat!
  For the totally inept in the kitchen (or kids):
  Don't leave out ingredients...So what if you can't find the vanilla.
  If you leave it out, the fudge will taste about the same, but it will
  be hard enough to use as asphalt patch. You'll ruin the pan using a
  chisel to get the fudge out...Don't overcook!...Mix well! You should
  end up with a uniform texture about the same appearance as Hershey's
  Syrup... It has to cool before it turns solid...Buttering the pan
  means putting just a little butter or margarine on a clean piece of
  paper toweling and rubbing the bottom of the pan with it. Pretend
  your waxing the car.

  Hi Scott, hi Stacy!  Know you love desserts, so I thought I'd share
  this fabulous recipe from Bon Appetit with you. Granted, it is a bit
  time-consuming, but should keep you busy - and...it is so worth the
  wait. Whisk yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, and Marsala in large metal
  bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not
  allow water to touch bottom of bowl).  Using portable electric mixer
  beat until mixture triples in volume about 5 minutes. Cover
  zabaglione and refrigerate until well chilled.  (Can be prepared 2
  days ahead). Place mascarpone in large bowl. Using electric mixer
  whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to soft peaks.
  Fold into mascarpone.  Gently fold in zabaglione. Refrigerate until
  well chilled about 3 hours. Combine espresso coffee, rum, 3
  tablespoons sugar, and vanilla in small bowl. Brush over both sides
  of cake pieces.  Place generous tablespoon mascarpone mixture in
  bottom of each of 8 balloon-shaped wineglasses. Set cake square or
  wedge into each at angle. Top with remaining mascarpone mixture.
  Combine shaved chocolate and ground coffee
         03/13/92        2:41 PM beans.  Sprinkle over
  desserts.  Refrigerate until chilled at least 30 minutes and up to 3
  hours. NOTE:  Instead of 12x6x1 layer sponge cake cut into eight 3
  squares you may use a 9 round sponge cake cut into 8 wedges. Take all
  the time you need to enjoy this scrumptious recipe! Rita in ever so

  or till chocolate is melted, stirring after 30 seconds.  Stir about
  HALF of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolk.  Return all to the
  bowl, mixing well.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 50% power for 1 to 2
  minutes or till thickened, stirring every 15 seconds.  Stir in
  vanilla.  Pour into pot de creme cup or 6 ounce custard cup.  Cover
  and chill for several hours or till firm.  Garnish with whipped
  cream, if desired.
  NOTE: SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE: You'll find three basic types of
  chocolate in the baking supplies department of most supermarkets--
  semisweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate. The
  semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is just slight
  sweetened with sugar. Unsweetened chocolate is the original baking or
  cooking chocolate and has no added flavorings or sugar. And sweet
  chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate used in the Chocolate
  Pots de Creme recipe, is chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes
  additional cocoa butter or flavorings.

 Categories: Cakes, Texas, Desserts, Sauces
      Yield: 10 servings
      2    9-inch layers of choc. Cake
      1    Fudge Icing (Recipe)
      1    Caramel Sauce (Recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted
      2 c  Heavy Cream
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate
    1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
      2 ts Butter
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Heavy Cream
  FOR CAKE:
     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel
  Sauce and Cashews.
   Repeat with next 2 cake layers.  Place final cake layer on top,
  frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover sides of cake
  with chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in
  chocolate until melted and smooth. This will be very soft but will
  harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable consistency.
         NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable consistency
  depends on the weather.  This is much like making fudge candy. The
  author, (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and
  had no problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and
  reduce to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter),
  add cream. Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny

    1/2 c  Cocoa powder (not a mix)
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
  1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Boiling water
--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter
      2 c  Confectioners' sugar
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           - melted
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Half-and-half OR milk OR
           - evaporated milk
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease 2 8-inch layer cake pans well, then
  dust them generously with cocoa. (This gives the cake layers a rich
  brown finish). Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto a
  piece of waxed paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until it is
  fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until the
  batter is silvery and light. Beat the eggs in one by one, then add
  the sifted dry ingredients, alternately with the boiling water,
  beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and beating well after
  each addition. Divide the batter equally between the two pans,
  smoothing the tops. Bake the layers uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes,
  or until the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to pull away
  from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers upright in their pans on
  wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully loosen them around the
  edges with a spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them
  completely. FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until it is light,
  then add the confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while.
  Beat in the melted chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream
  to make the frosting a good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the
  two cake layers together with frosting, then frost the top and sides
  of the cake. Swirl the frosting into peaks and valleys.

  minutes, then drop in the butter, add the vanilla and heat until
  satiny. You couldn't get a more authentic hot fudge sauce than this!

  has puffed and trembles just slightly when shaken. A wooden skewer
  inserted in the cake should come out almost clean, with just a trace
  of batter or moist crumbs on it. Don't overbake; it will settle and
  firm somewhat as it cools. Don't worry if the cake cracks as it
  bakes. Remove and cool. Refrigerate if standing more than 4 hours.
  Garnish the top with grated chocolate.

    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Orange Liqueur
  This striking and unusual dessert utilizes three flavors which
  harmonize beautifully in taste and appearance.
  Preparing the Sponge.  Butter a 9-inch diameter x 2 1/2 - to - inch
  deep springform pan and line the bottom with a piece of parchment
  paper, cut to fit.  Process the nuts in a food processor until very
  fine. Sift the cake flour over the nuts and combine.  Whip the yolks,
  then whip in half the sugar until light in color and aerated.  Whip
  the egg whites and salt on medium speed until white and opqaque.
  Increase the speed and whip in the remaining sugar.  Continue
  whipping the whites until the whites hold a firm peak.  Fold the
  yolks into the whites, then fold in the pistachio mixture in two or
  three additions.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350
  degrees F about 30 minutes.  Remove from the pan and cool on a rack,
  on the paper.
  Preparing the Ganache.  Place the chocolate in a bowl.  Bring the
  cream to a boil and pour over the chocolate.  Let stand 2 minutes,
  then whisk smooth and strain into another bowl.  Refrigerate,
  whisking until cool, but not set.
  Preparing the Syrup.  Combine the water and sugar in a small pan and
  bring to a boil.  Cool and stir in the orange liqueur.
  Preparing the Filling.  Finely chop the peel and combine with the
  liqueur.
  Preparing the Whipped Cream.  Combine the cream, sugar and liqueur
  and whip on medium speed until firm.
  Assembling.  Using a sharp serrated knife, divide the Pistachio
  Sponge into two layers and place one on a cardboard.  Moisten with
  half the syrup and spread with most of the Ganache, reserving some
  for a decoration. Drain the candied peel and distribute evenly on the
  Ganache. Cover with a layer of whipped cream.  Place the second layer
  on the cream and moisten with the remaining syrup.  Cover the outside
  of the cake with the shipped cream and press the shavings against the
  side of the cake. Make a border of rosettes around the edge of the
  cake with the remaining Ganache and decorate the rosettes with
  cutouts  of candied peel and some pistachios. Place some chipped
  pistachios in the center and dust them lightly with confectioners'
  sugar.
