1 c  Peaches       1 c  Pineapple       1 c  Marachino cherries       1 pk Yeast       3 c  Sugar     For the fermented fruit started take:      Mix these all together and stir daily.  Let set for 2 weeks.  I usually use   a  one gallon glass jug. Every second week add 1 c. sugar and 1 c. of   fruit.      For the cake portion mix: 1 box yellow cake mix 1 box instant pudding 1/2   c. oil 4 eggs 2 c. fruit 1 c. nuts      Mix and bake in a 350 degree over for one hour.  I usually use my bundt   pan.      Glaze 1 c. confectioner's sugar 1/3 c. lemon juice      I don't always glaze the cake and sometime add some of the juice to the   cake mix just to make it really moist and more flavorful.

Let ingredients sit in jar for 2 weeks, stirring daily. At the   end of two weeks, add the maraschino cherries, 1 cup of sugar and 2   tablespoons of brandy. Let the mixture sit for two more weeks, stirring   daily. During the forth week add the canned peaches, 1 cup of sugar, 2   tablespoons of brandy. Let sit another two weeks, stirring daily. Seperate   the liquid from the fruit. The liquid is your starter and you can use the   fruit on ice cream or cake. Now you are ready to prepare the fruit for two   cakes.      DO NOT refrigerate the liquid. In a large gallon jar, put 1 1/2 cups of the   starter, 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 large can (28 Oz.) sliced peaches. Mix   well and cover jar with a paper towel. Do not refrigerate or screw lid on   jar. Stir every day for 10 days. Next, add 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 can   (16 oz.) crushed pineapple. Stir everyday for 10 days. Add 2 1/2 cups sugar   and 1 can (16 oz.) fruit cocktail. Slice contents of 1 jar (10 oz.)   maraschino cherries and add with juice. Stir every day for 10 days.      On baking day, drain the fruit and divide it into two equal parts. Save the   juice and use it as starter for friends. You will have enough for five   starters (approximately 2 cups each). DO NOT refrigerate the liquid because   it will stop the fermenting action. For each cake you will need: To each   cake mix, add pudding mix, oil, and eggs. Beat until smooth and fold in   fruit and nuts, batter will be thick. Pour mixture into a greased tube pan,   then bake at 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes. Turn cake out of pan while   hot. When cooled, the cake freezes well. The choices of flavored cake mixes   and pudding mixes is yours and coconut may be substituted for nuts.              1 lg Gallon Jar       1 c  Cubed Pineapple       1 c  Sugar       2 tb Brandy       1 c  Maraschino Cherries            -including juice       1 c  Sugar       2 tb Brandy       1 c  Sliced Canned Peaches            -including juice       1 c  Sugar       2 tb Brandy            Cake:       1    Box Cake Mix       1 sm Box Instant Pudding     3/8 c  Cooking Oil       4    Eggs       1 c  Chopped Nuts       1    Portion Fruit     In the one gallon jar, combine the pineapple, 1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons   of brandy.

1 1/4 c  Unsifted flour       2 tb Sugar       1 ts Baking soda     3/4 ts Baking powder     1/4 ts Salt       1    Egg     3/4 c  Milk         1 1/4 c  Unsifted flour       2 tb Sugar       1 ts Baking soda     3/4 ts Baking powder     1/4 ts Salt       1    Egg     3/4 c  Milk        (You need a metal funnel to make these delicious Pennsylvania Dutch   specialties. )      about 1 quart - Corn oil Confectioners sugar      Stir together first 5 ingredients. Mix egg and milk; add to flour mixture.   Stir until batter is smooth. Pour oil into skillet (no more than 1/3 full).   Heat to 375 degrees. An electric fry pan is excellent for this. Holding   forefinger over end of funnel, pour 1/4 cup into funnel. Place over hot oil   and remove finger to let batter flow. As batter flows, move funnel in a   circle to form a spiral cake. Fry, turning once, 2 minutes or until golden   brown. Drain and sprinkle with sugar. Repeat. Makes enough for 6 funnel   cakes.      Note: instead of the sugar, try drizzling with a thin icing and sprinkle   with chopped nuts.  
1 1/3 c  Flour,     1/4 ts Salt,     1/2 ts Soda,       2 tb Sugar,     3/4 ts Baking powder,       1    Egg, beaten,     2/3 c  Milk, or more as needed,            Oil for frying, and            Powdered sugar.            Into a large bowl, sift            -together:   1 1/3 c  Flour,     1/4 ts Salt,     1/2 ts Soda,       2 tb Sugar, and     3/4 ts Baking powder.            Next, in another bowl, blend            -together:       1    Egg, beaten, and     2/3 c  Milk, or more as needed.     It is hard to know if this should really be called a cake, but it has   historically been called a cake, so it is a cake, even if it is fried. This   desert appeals to children of all ages, it is a homey, and homely, classic   ~ attractive in its own strange way, and very tasty.  I have seen it served   with whipped cream and fruit toppings, so let your imagination run wild   with the toppings.  This is a Pennsylvania-Dutch recipe, and was printed in   the food section of the September 25, 1986 Austin American-Statesman. This   recipe was credited to Laura Worm, Louise Lightsey, and Jeanene Demel.      Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ones.  Beat until smooth.      Fill a skillet or pan with 1 inch of cooking oil and heat to a temperature   of 375 F.  Now cover the small hole of a clean funnel with a finger.  Then   fill the funnel with the batter.  Carefully move your finger away from the   hole in the funnel, allowing the batter to flow into the skillet. Move the   funnel to form patterns with the batter.  Fry until golden brown, about 1   or 2 minutes, turning once with two spatulas.  Remove to paper toweling to   drain. Place on a plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Serve hot.   Repeat the process until all of the batter is used up.

Stir together   flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add to egg mixture; beat smooth with   rotary beater.      In a 8 inch skillet heat cooking oil to 360 Degrees.  Using a finger to   cover the bottom of a funnel with a 1/2 inch spout (inside diameter), pour   a generous 1/2 cup of batter into funnel.  Remove finger and release batter   into the hot oil, moving funnel in a circular motion to form a spiral. Cook   about 2 1/2 minutes or till golden brown.  Using 2 wide metal spatulas,   turn cake carefully.  Cook about 1 minute more. Drain on paper toweling;   sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Repeat with remaining batter. Serve warm   cakes with maple syrup, if desired.  
1    Egg, beaten     2/3 c  Milk   1 1/4 c  Flour       2 tb Sugar       1 ts Baking powder     1/4 ts Salt     Beat milk with egg.  Blend dry ingredients and gradually add the milk   mixture, beating constantly until batter is smooth.  Holding your finger   over bottom of a funnel having a 3/8 to 1/2 inch hole, fill funnel with   batter.  Holding funnel as near surface of fat as possible, remove finger   and drop batter into deep fat heated to 375 using a circular movement from   center outward to form a spiral cake about 3" in diameter.  Immediately   replace finger on bottom of funnel and then form other cakes (as many as   will float uncrowded).  Fry until cakes are puffy and golden brown, turning   once.  Remove cakes with a slotted spoon to absorbent paper to drain.  Sift   confectioners' sugar lightly over cakes or drizzle with molasses and serve   at once. 2 - 2-1/2 dozen cakes      From: Pennsylvania Dutch CookBook of Fine Old Recipes Shared By: Pat   Stockett

Butter an 8-inch square baking pan, preferably glass. Cut the   peaches into 1/2-inch slices. Put in a pan with sugar, lemon juice, tapioca   and nutmeg and toss gently. Cook over high heat until syrup begins to   bubble, about 4 minutes. Set aside.      FOR THE TOPPING: Work the flour into the sugar, butter and cinnamon until   the butter is the size of small peas. This can be done with a food   processor or pastry blender. Set aside.      FOR THE CAKE: Stir the sour cream and baking soda together and let stand   while you begin the cake. Cream the egg, sugar and butter in the processor   or with a mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and sour   cream and mix well. Gently fold in the flour, baking powder and salt. In   the processor, do this by pulsing the machine on and off several times.   Spread the warm peaches and their juice in the bottom of the baking pan.   Spoon the batter over the peaches and spread in a thin, even layer with a   rubber spatula. It's OK if the peaches are not completely covered. Sprinkle   the topping over the batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the   center of the cake--not the fruit--comes out clean, 25-to-28 minutes.      ABBY MANDEL - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK

Cook the mixture, uncovered, over moderately high   heat, stirring, until the water is almost evaporated. Force the mixture   through a food mill into a bowl, and allow the puree to cool. (I zap it in   my food processor, until it is a puree).       Generously butter a 9" springform pan and preheat the oven to 350 deg. F.   In a large bowl cream the butter, beat in the sugar and beat the mixture   until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and the apple puree. Into a bowl,   sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt.   Stir the flour mixture and the pecans gently into the apple mixture and   pour the batter into the springform pan. Peel and core the Granny Smith   apples, halve them lengthwise and cut them crosswise into thin slices.   *Arrange the apple slices decoratively in bunches on the batter, pressing   them lightly into the batter.    Bake the cake in the middle of the oven for 1 1/4 hours, or until a cake   tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cake to a rack.      In a small saucepan melt the jam over low heat, brush it over the cake and   let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes. Run a sharp knife   around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake and remove the sides of the   pan.  Serve the cake warm or at room temperature with the whipped cream, if   desired.  Note: If you prefer, substitute 3 large firm pears to make the   fruit puree.  Use 2 firm but ripe unpeeled pears, halved lengthwise, cored   and cut into thin slices for the top of the cake.      Note:* You should be able to make about 14 groups bunches of the sliced   Granny Smith Apples, and arrange them in 12 groups around the cake, with   two groups in the center, sort of like a flower. Press the slices in,   keeping the round side of the slices up, and pressing them straight into   the batter. This is a lovely looking cake.

Butter two 9-inch layer pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper   circles. Rebutter parchment paper.      Put broken graham crackers and coconut into the container of a food   processor fitted with steel blade.  Process until the cracker crumbs and   coconut are ground very fine.  Add the baking powder and pulse 6 to 8 times   to blend.  Set aside.      Cut the butter into 1-inch pieces and put them in the large bowl of an   electric mixer fitted with beaters or paddle attachment.  Soften on low   speed.  Increase speed to medium-high and cream the butter until smooth and   light in color, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.      Add the sugar, 1 Tbsp at a time, take 6 to 8 minutes to blend it in well.   Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally.      Add the the yolks, 2 at a time at 1-minute intervals, scraping the sides of   the bowl as necessary.  Beat 1 minute longer.  Blend in the vanilla.      Reduce mixer Speed to low.  Add the crumb mixture alternately with the   milk, dividing the crumbs into three parts and the liquid into two parts,   starting and ending with the crumbs.  Scrape the sides of the bowl and mix   for 10 seconds longer.  Transfer to a large bowl and set aside.      Put the egg whites in a separate bowl and beat them on medium speed with   clean dry beaters or whip attachment until frothy.  Add the cream of tartar   and increase the speed to medium high.  Beat until the whites form firm   moist peaks.  With a 2 3/4 inch wide rubber spatula, fold in one quarter of   the whites to lighten the batter, taking about 20 turns.  Fold in the   remaining whites, taking about 20 additional turns.      Spoon the batter into the prepared pans, smoothing the surface with the   back of a tablespoon.  Bake in the preheated oven 25 to 30 minutes, or   until cake begins to come away from the sides of the pan and is springy to   the touch.      Remove cake from oven.  Set the pans onto cake racks for 10 minutes to cool   slightly, then invert onto racks sprayed with nonstick coating.  Lift off   the pans and carefully peel off the parchment.  When the cake is completely   cool, fill and frost.

I   have made it since the 1950's so I would consider it a classic. Grease the   bottoms and sides of two 9 X 1 1/2-inch layer cake pans and preheat the   oven to 350 degrees F.      Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending well, and   set aside.  Cream the shortening and sugar, with an electric mixer set on   high, and beat in the eggs and vanilla extract and continue beating until   light and fluffy.  Blend the cocoa into the hot water to make a smooth   paste.  Gradually add the cocoa mixture to the creamed mixture, stirring to   blend well.  Add the flour mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed   mixture, beating well after each addition. Pour the batter into the   prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until   the tops spring back when lightly pressed. Cool on racks for 10 minutes and   remove from the pans to cool completely.

Add Crisco a little at a time.   Cream another 3 or 4 minutes. Add the sugar a little at a time while   continuing to beat. Then add the milk, mixed first with the vanilla,   beating and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl frequently. The   longer you beat this the better it becomes.      The Cake:      Preheat oven to 350. Grease two 8-inch-square cake pans or baking dishes,   or use a 13x9x2-inch pan. Beat 1 minute after each addition. Pour batter   into prepared pans. Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes (40-45 minutes for an   oblong pan) or until you can insert a toothpick and it comes out clean.   Cool the cake in pan on a rack. It's best to use the cake for Twinkles when   it is slightly frozen - about 30 minutes in the freezer. Then cut them into   1-1/2 by 3-1/2 inch bars. Put bottom side of each bar up on waxed paper.   Spread half of the bars with the filling and put together with an unfrosted   bar, sandwich style. Refrigerates up to 2 weeks, freezes up to 1 year.

"Too much egg and the cake falls in the center," she says.      Grease a Bundt pan.  Dust with fine bread crumbs and chill.      Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt the chocolate with the shortening.      Combine eggs, water, milk, and vanilla.  Blend well.  Mix flour, sugar,   soda, and salt thoroughly. (If you don't, the flour will clump in the   batter.) Gradually add dry ingredients to liquid ingredients, blending on   low speed of mixer until just mixed, scraping bowl well. Pour into pan and   bake until done, 50-65 minutes. Cool in the pan 30 minutes. Turn out on a   cake rack and glaze with icing.      Icing:  While cake is cooling, heat the sugar in the evaporated milk in the   top of a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved. (The mixture will not   feel grainy when rubbed between the fingers.) Melt butter and chocolate   together.  Combine with chocolate mixture. You may add one to two tsp hot   water to the icing to enhance the sheen. Pour icing over the cake.      Texas French Bread bakery, Austin, TX

1 pk White Cake Mix       2 pk Jello (3 Oz) Any Flavor       2 c  Boiling Water       8 oz Cool Whip, Thawed     Bake cake mix as directed on package.  Remove from pans to cool.  Rewash   pans and put cakes back in them when the cakes are completely cooled.  It   is best to use 2 8-9" round cake pans but you can use an oblong pan if you   want.  After cakes have been place back into pans (top side up), prick them   with utility fork at 1/2" intervals.  Meanwhile, dissolve each flavor   separately in 1 cup boiling water.  Carefully pour one flavor gelatin over   each cake layer (if using oblong pan you must use the same flavors for the   2 pks).  Chill 3-4 hours.  Dip one cake pan in warm water for 10 sseconds,   then unmold cake layer onto serving plate.  Top with about 1 c. cool whip.   Unmold second cake layer and carefully place on first layer. Frost with   remaining topping.  Chill.  Great moist'n fruity cake especially for those   who like a light, refreshing cake that is not too sweet.

2 c  Raisins     1/2 c  Bourbon     1/4 c  Butter; softened   1 1/2 c  Sugar       5    Eggs       4 c  Flour; sifted       2 ts Baking powder       1 ts Baking soda       1 pn Salt       1 ts Lemon zest; grated       1 tb Lemon juice       1 c  Pecans; chopped      Marinate raisins in 1 cup of the bourbon for at least 1 hour, up to 12   hours; drain, reserving both raisins and bourbon. Preheat oven to 350   degrees. Butter and flour a 10-inch Bundt cake pan or other tube-cake pan.    Beat together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. (For best   results, use an electric mixer and start beating at a slow speed, gradually   increasing to moderate. If you allow this process to take about 15 minutes,   the butter will be very pale and look something like whipped cream. This   adds lightness to the cake.) Beat in the eggs 1 at a time, beating well   after each. In another bowl, sift together 3 3/4 cups of the flour, baking   powder, soda and salt. Combine reserved bourbon with the zest and lemon   juice. Add dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternatelywith the   bourbon mixture.    Toss the remaining 1/4 cup of flour with the drained raisins and the   pecans. Fold into batter. Bake about 1 1/2 hours or until the cake tests   done. Cool about 10 minutes in the pan before turninout onto a rack. Brush   the remaining 1/2 cup of bourbon over the cake while it is still somewhat   warm.    For long storage, wrap the cake in rinsed cheesecloth that has been   thoroughly moistened in bourbon. Then wrap in plastic of oil so that it is   airtight. The cake may be served after a day or two but is better if   allowed to age.

3/4 lb Butter       2 c  White sugar   2 1/4 c  Light brown sugar, firmly            -packed       6    Eggs   5 1/2 c  All purpose flour     1/4 ts Salt       1 ts Mace       2 c  Bourbon whiskey   3 1/2 c  (1 lb) pecan nuts chopped     Cream butter and approx. half of the sugar, in another bowl, beat the eggs   with the remaining sugars until light and fluffy (several minutes at   least). Combine the butter and egg mixtures. Sift the dry ingredients and   add them along with the whiskey a little at a time to the egg/butter   mixture. Finally stir pecans into the batter. Bake in a slow oven in a   large (10 inch) tube type pan for appox 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until a knife   inserted into the cake comes out clean. The recipe now says to wrap the   cool cake in Al foil and keep in the fridge for a week or two to let the   flavors "meld", however everyone around my house usually consumes it in the   following few days.  This cake when baked still contains a substantial   amount of whiskey! Its rather surprizing.  I assume the vapors get trapped   in the cake or whatever.  It tastes great (really great) with a blob of   sweetened whipped cream (with vanilla of course). BTW this makes a heck of   a large cake.  I have made little cakes in those minature loaf pans to give   as Xmas gifts and it worked great, dividing the recipe in half.

I was in a hurry   to get it in the oven and done in time for supper, and I didn't read it   right.  I nonchalantly threw in four eggs, the sugar and the oil and beat   it up before I noticed that it was only the whites that I needed...  All I   did to bail myself out of this was to add another 1/4 cup milk and about 1   1/4 cup flour and carried on with dignity.. 8-}  It turned out okay.. took   a bit longer to cook, but the kids said it was really good.**      So... make sure you read the recipe ALL the way through before throwing   stuff in the bowl... 8-}

Stir in the buttermilk; the mixture should be cool.   Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt onto a sheet of waxed   paper.      Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium   speed until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after   each addition.  Add the vanilla.  Beat the dry ingredients into the butter   mixture, alternating with the cocoa mixture, beginning and ending with the   dry ingredients.  Pour into the prepared pan.      Bake for 20 minutes or until the center springs back when lightly pressed.   Cool the cake in the pan on a large wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn the cake   out onto the rack to cool completely.  Remove the waxed paper.      PREPARE THE FILLING:  Heat the granulated sugar and water to boiling in a   very small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Boil   until the temperature registers 240 F on a candy thermometer, about 10   minutes.      Meanwhile, beat the heavy cream, 10 X sugar, and vanilla in a small bowl   until stiff.  Cover and refrigerate.      Using clean beaters, beat together the egg whites and cream of tartar in a   large bowl until soft peaks form.  Slowly beat the hot syrup into the egg   whites, beating until the meringue forms stiff peaks and is cool.      Place the raspberries in a blender or food processor.  Whirl for about 5   seconds to puree.  Fold the raspberries and grenadine into the whipped   cream.  Gently fold the meringue into the raspberry cream.  Set aside.      ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cut the cake crosswise into three equal rectangles (5 x   10 inches).  Place one rectangle on a serving platter. Top with 2 cups of   the filling.  Repeat two more times, ending with a layer of raspberry   cream.  Garnish with whipped cream, orange zest, or fresh raspberries, if   you wish.

100 g  Flaky pastry (3 1/2 oz)      30 g  Raspberries (1 oz)     110 g  Sugar (3 3/4 oz)      75 g  Ground hazelnuts (2 1/2 oz)       2 x  Egg whites            Grated rind of 1 lemon            Caster sugar            Icing sugar            Slivered almonds     Puree the raspberries in a liquidiser with 35 g ( 1 1/4 oz) of the sugar,   then pass the mixture through a tamis.      Prepare a macaroon paste by mixing, with a spatula, the rest of the sugar,   the ground powered nuts, the egg whites and lemon rind.      Roll out the pastry to a thickness of 2-3 mm ( 1/8 in) and line an 18 cm (   7 in) tart tin with a removable base. Prick it all over with the prongs of   a fork (Put it in a refrigerator if you are not going to bake it at once).      Pre-heat the oven to 220 oC/425 oF.      Lightly sprinkle caster sugar over the uncooked pastry, then spread the   raspberry puree over it in a smooth layer.      Spread the macaroon mixture over the raspberry, smoothing the surface with   the help of a spatula.      Cook the cake for 40 minutes in the pre-heated oven. Reduce the heat to 180   oC/350 oF after 20 minutes if it is browning too quickly. Take it out and   leave it to cool a little.      Scatter the slivered almonds over the top of the cake while it is still   warm. Sprinkle the cake with icing sugar then put it under  hot grill for   just long enough to caramelise the sugar lightly. Take care, as this takes   barely a minute.      Let the cake cool, then take it out of the tin.      (From: Fredy Girardet, Cuisine Spontanee, M Papermac, ISBN 0 333 40957 4)

Bake in greased   15x9x2- inch pan, in a moderate oven ( 35O degrees F.) 30 minutes, or until   cake is done. When cold, trim edges, cut in half crosswise, and put   together as a two-layer cake, matching edges carefully. Spread tops and   sides with Martha Washington's Fudge Frosting (See recipe). Or add chopped   nut meats to part of frosting and use as filling. This recipe has been   adapted to modern measurements from Marthas Washington's own recipe. It is   an excellent choice for February parties or for any occasion where a deluxe   cake is desired.

Beat in an electric mixer   fitted with chilled beaters or whip attachment.  Stir in the confectioner's   sugar and cocoa and beat on medium speed until the cream begins to thicken.   Add the coffee zest and liqueur.  Continue whipping until cream reaches the   soft peak stage, and remove from the mixer.  Finish beating by hand using a   wire whisk, whipping until cream is quite thick but not grainy.   Refrigerate.      Note:  to make coffee zest, add 3 parts coffee crystals to 1 part boiling   water.      To assemble the cake, split each layer into halves.  Set the first layer on   a serving plate, top side down.  Fit a 14-inch pastry bag with a large no.   5 plain tube, and fill it 1/3 rd full with mocha whipped cream.  Starting   1/2 inch from the edge, pipe a circle of cream around the top of the layer.   Fill center of the circle with additional cream, smoothing surface with a   large metal offset spatula.  Repeat with the second and third layers,   placing them cut side up. Arrange the top layer cut side down, aligning   layers so the sides of the cake are even.      Empty the remaining whipped cream into the pastry bag.  Pipe 1/2 inch   whipped cream dots on the top layer, beginning at the outer edge.  Each dot   should touch the preceding one, forming a ring.  Continue working toward   the center of the cake until the entire surface is covered.      Place 1/2 tsp cocoa in a very fine mesh strainer.  Gently tap the strainer   over the surface of the cake to give it a light dusting of cocoa.  Place   the cake in the refrigerator uncovered to chill, but remove from   refrigerator at least 1 hour before serving.      Storage:  Store leftover cake in the refrigerator under a foil tent.  This   cake will keep for up to three days.

MAPLE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING:      1/2    cup    Crisco shortening (regular only) 1/2 cup butter, softened 1   tsp.   maple flavoring (like vanilla extract) 4 cups (1 lb.) powdered sugar   2      Tbsp.  milk      Cream butter and shortening.  Add maple flavoring. Gradually add powdered   sugar.  Gradually add milk and continue beating until light and airy.  Add   more milk if needed.  Color with paste colors.      This icing is a light yellow and colors you add will be affected by this.   For pure white icing, use 1 cup regular Crisco shortening and 1/2 tsp.   Wilton butter flavoring. This icing is somewhat stiffer.  For blazing   white, add Wilton White White.  Wilton White White will also make the first   buttercream recipe whiter, but be careful with colors as they will still   tend to be yellowish.      Note:  Excellent cake and frosting!

When frosting is   set, write the numbers from one to twelve around top of cake with white   frosting to represent the face of a clock. Place hands of clock at twelve   o'clock.      Chocolate Cream Filling Add chocolate to milk and heat in double boiler.   When chocolate is melted, beat with rotary egg beater until blended.   Combine sugar, flour, and salt; add gradually to chocolate mixture and cook   until thickened, stirring occasionally. Pour small amount of mixture over   egg yolks, stirring vigorously; return to double boiler and cook 2 minutes   longer, stirring constantly. Add butter and vanilla, and cool. Makes 2 1/2   cups filling, or enough filling to spread between three 9-inch layers. Use   this filling in small cup cakes. Use 1/2 recipe for filling 2 1/2 to 3   dozen small cup cakes.      Hungarian Chocolate Frosting Melt chocolate in double boiler. Remove from   boiling water, add sugar and water, and blend. Add egg yolks, one at a   time, beating will after each. Add butter, a tablespoon at a time, beating   thoroughly after each amount. Makes enough frosting to cover the top of one   9-inch layer and sides of three 9-inch layers, or to cover the tops and   sides of two 9-inch layers.

TO MAKE THE CAKE: Sift the unbleached flour and pastry flour together.   Return the flour to the sifte. In a 5-6 puart bowl, beat the egg whites   with an electric mixer until bubbly. Add the orange extract and cream of   tartar.  Beat on medium speed until the whites form soft peaks. Gradually   beat in the honey until the whites are stiff. Sift about 1/4 cup of the   flour over the whites. Carefully fold it in with a large spatula. Repeat   until all the flour has been incorporated. Spoon batter into an ungreased   9-10 inch ungreased tube pan with removable bottom. Level top with a   spatula.  Bake at 325 F for about 40-50 minutes, or until the top is golden   and springs back when lightly touched. Invert the pan onto a wire rack and   let the cake cool for 1 hour. To remove the cake from the pan, run a thin   knife around the outside edges. Remove the outer portion of the pan. Run a   thin knife around the center tube and also around the center tube and also   around the bottom of the cake.  Invert the cake onto a serving plate. Serve   with the orange sections and orange cream.  (If desired, place the cream in   a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe it decoratively around or onto   each slice.)      ***NOTE***  To make the yogurt cheese, spoon about 4 cups of nonfat yogurt   into a sieve lined with a triple thickness of cheese cloth. Place over a   bowl, cover and refrigerate for 4 hours, or until very thick.      Origin:  Prevention Magazine, June 1992 issue Shared by: Sharon Stevens.

Toast the coconut on a baking pan in the   middle of the oven, shaking the pan occasionally for 10 minutes. Let the   coconut cool.    In the bowl of a mixer, combine the granulated sugar, egg whites, orange   juice, corn syrup, grated orange rind, and salt. Set the bowl over a   saucepan containing 3 inches of boiling water, and whisk the mixture until   it is hot and foamy.  Return the bowl to the mixer and beat the frosting at   high speed for 7 minutes, or until it is cool and holds stiff peaks.    Makes about 3 cups.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.   Have ready an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable bottom. (Do not   use a tube pan with a nonstick surface.)      2. Sift the flour, half cup sugar, the baking powder, and salt into a   medium-sized bowl. Form a well in the center and add the melted butter,   orange zest, orange juice, and the yolks, and vanilla. With an electric   mixer, beat until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.      3. In a large bowl combine the egg whites and cream of tartar; beat with an   electric mixer until soft peaks begin to form. Gradually beat in the   remaining half cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff glossy peaks   form. Stir a large spoonful of the whites into the batter to lighten. With   a spatula, quickly fold in the remaining egg whites, half at a time, to   make a fluffy batter that is even in color. Turn into the ungreased tube   pan and bake one hour to one hour and 15 minutes, until the top springs   back when lightly touched and a toothpick inserted emerges without crumbs   clinging to it. Immediately invert and let the cake hang upside down until   completely cool. (If the pan does not have tabs on it's rim, place tube   over the neck of a bottle). Turn right side up and run a sharp knife around   the edge to separate the cake from the pan. Remove sides. Run a knife   around the center tube and under the cake; remove the pan bottom. Turn the   cake right side up on a serving plate.      4. Prepare glaze: In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar, orange   zest, and orange juice to make a glaze. Spread over the top of the cake,   letting some drip down the sides. Let stand at room temperature until glaze   has set, about one hour.      From: Jim Fobel's Old-Fashioned Baking Book

1 cn Pineapple Slices In Syrup            (1 pound 4 ozs)     1/4 c  Butter     2/3 c  Brown Sugar, Firmly Packed            Maraschino Cherries       1 c  Unbleached Flour, Unsifted     3/4 c  Granulated Sugar   1 1/2 ts Baking Powder     1/2 ts Salt     1/2 c  Milk     1/4 c  Vegetable Oil (Or Solid            Vegetable Shortening)       1 lg Egg     1/4 ts Grated Lemon Rind       1 ts Lemon Juice       1 ts Vanilla Extract     This one may be a little strange to you, but is a classic in its own right.   The difference between this one and the one you usually find in the   cookbook, is that this one uses a skillet for a baking pan.      Drain the pineapple, reserving 2 Tbls of the juice.  Melt the butter in a   heavy 10-inch ovenproof skillet.  Stir in the brown sugar and reserved   pineapple syrup, blending well.  Remove from the heat. Arrange the   pineapple slices in the sugar mixture in a balanced arrangement. Place a   maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple slice.      Combine the flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the   milk and oil then beat, with an electric mixer set on high speed, for 2   minutes.  Add the egg, lemon rind, lemon juice and vanilla extract and beat   for an additional 2 minutes.  Carefully pour the batter over the pineapple   in the skillet, spreading evenly. Bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes   or until the cake tests done. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack   for 5 minutes. Place a serving plate upside down on the top of the skillet   and invert the skillet and plate. Serve this cake warm.      VARIATION:      For Peach Upside-Down Cake, use a can of peach halves instead of the   pineapple slices and proceed as above.      From The Food Fare Section Rocky Mountain News September 3, 1986

Remove pineapple with slotted spoon and reserve. Continue cooking until   liquid is reduced nearly to a glaze. Add brown sugar and cook until mixture   becomes smooth, about 2 minutes. Replace pineapple slices, arranging them   nicely in syrup. Pour cake batter over fruit. Bake on middle rack 20 to 25   minutes. When done, wooden pick inserted into center of cake will come out   clean. Place large platter over skillet and turn upside down to remove cake   from skillet. Let cool before serving.

PS:  This makes a big cake which will keep much longer than I've ever seen   one last.  It's also almost impossible to overbake.  A couple years ago I   was making one as an Xmas gift for friends. I went to bed, forgetting to   remove the cake from the oven, and it baked all night long. When I finally   got it out of the oven (over 7 hours after it went in) the cake was   perfectly OK except for a suface layer about �" deep that was a bit dry. I   made another cake for the gift, but my family gobbled the "mistake" in   short order.

1 c  Seedless Raisins       1 c  Walnuts       2 c  All-Purpose Flour       2 ts Baking Soda     1/4 ts Baking Powder     1/2 ts Salt       2 ts Ground Cloves       2 ts Ground Cinnamon       1 ts Ground Ginger       4    Eggs       2 c  Granulated Sugar       1 c  Salad Oil      16 oz Canned Pumpkin     Preheat oven to 325-degrees. Sterilize 8 (1 pint, straight-sided) Kerr or   Ball Quilted Crystal (12 oz, straight-sided, Ball #14400-81400) canning   jars, lids and rings by in boiling water for 10 minutes. Remove the jars   from the water and allow to air-dry. Leave the lids and rings in the hot   water until ready to use. Once cool, brush (use a pastry brush) the inside   of jars with shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside.   Coarsely chop the nuts and raisins; set aside. Sift together the flour,   baking powder, baking soda, salt cloves, cinnamon and ginger in a large   bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss lightly to combine. In another large   bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and yellow (2-3 minutes).   Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and light. At low speed, beat in   the oil and pumpkin; blend thoroughly. Gradually stir in the flour mixture   until  well blended. Divide batter among the 8 canning jars (should be   slightly less than 1/2 full). Wipe the sides of the jar off   (inside/outside) in case you slop or it'll burn. Place jars on a cookie   sheet or they'll tip over. Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for 35-40   minutes or until a toothpick inserted deep into the center of the cakes   comes out clean. When cakes test done, remove the jars, one-by-one, place a   lid, then a ring onto each jar, screw down tightly. USE HEAVY-DUTY MITTS!   The jars are H O T ! Place jars onto your counter to cool. You'll be able   to tell if they've sealed--you'll hear a "plinking" sound. If you miss the   sound, test each jar by pushing on the lids once the jars are cool, they   shouldn't move at all. These will keep in a cool, dark place for about 1   year. I'm not sure, they don't last that long around here!

The cake remains moist and delicious, however, for several   days.      PREPARATION: Heat oven to 325F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square or   10-inch round cake pan. Cut the 4 ounces of chocolate into small pieces and   melt in the top of a double boiler set over hot water, stirring frequently.   Remove pan from hot water and cool slightly. In a food processor, nut   grinder or blender, grind the 4 ounces of almonds to a powder. If you use a   processor or blender, put 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the machine along   with the nuts.  Put ground nuts through a sieve to get rid of any remaining   chunks.  Toss the powdered almond mixture with the flour. Separate the   eggs.  Beat together the butter and 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar until   creamy and light.  Add the melted chocolate and the extract. Add the egg   yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Beat the   whites to stiff peaks, add the remaining sugar, and beat until glossy. Fold   in nut mixture.  Gently followed egg white mixture into chocolate just   until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in a   preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes   out almost clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.   point up to a day ahead.      CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Heat the chocolate and butter in the top of a double   boiler set over hot water, stirring frequently, until just melted. Remove   from hot water. Cool the chocolate glaze just until it thickens. It should   a pan to catch drippings. Garnish with almonds if desired.      Serve at room temperature or refrigerate for up to 4 days.

In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer over moderate   heat. Butter a 9 by 13 inch glass baking dish.      2. Melt 4 tbsp of the butter in a large non-reactive saucepan. Add the   onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened,   about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir until coated with butter, 1 to 2   minutes. Raise the heat to moderately high and pour in the wine. Cook,   stirring, until almost all the wine is absorbed, about 4 minutes.      3. Add about 1 cup of the simmering stock ( enough to just cover the rice )   and cook, stirring constantly, until the stock is absorbed. Continue adding   stock, about 1 cup at a time; stir constantly until the stock is absorbed   before adding more. The rice is done when it is just cooked through and   lightly bound with with creamy liquid, after about 15 minutes. Remove from   the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Let cool slightly, then stir in   the egg. Spread the risotto evenly in the prepared baking dish. Cover and   refrigerate until very firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.      4. Cut the risotto into 16 even squares. Shape each square into a disk,   about 2 1/2" in diameter and 1/2" thick. Coat the disks with flour and   refrigerate on a baking sheet until firm, about 20 minutes.      5. In a skillet, melt 1 tbsp of the butter in 1 tbsp of the olive oil. Add   8 of the cakes to the skillet and cook over moderately high heat, turning   once, until browned and warmed through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer   the cakes to a warm serving platter, cover and keep warm in a low oven.   Wipe out the pan and repeat with the remaining butter, oil, and risotto   cakes. (The risotto cakes can be fried up to 1 day ahead. To serve, warm   them in a 450 degree oven for about 10 minutes, or until heated through.)

Add the eggs, one at a time. Add the sour cream   and vanilla. Beat until well blended. Sift together the dry ingredients. I   usually just blend them instead of sifting. Add them to the creamed   mixture. Mix well. Spoon about 1/2 the batter into a greased 10" tube pan.   Sprinkle batter with Choc. Chips. I use enough to ALMOST cover the batter.   Spoon the rest of the batter over the Choc. Chips. Sprinkle with remaining   Chips and Cinnamon sugar. Bake at 350 for 40-45 minutes or until cake   tester comes out clean.
