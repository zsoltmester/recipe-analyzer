      Title: BROILED CHICKEN OREGANO
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 ea Chicken breast
      1 ea Garlic clove; quartered
      1 x  ----marinade----
    1/3 c  Lemon juice
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
      3 T  Oregano; fresh or 1 tbsp dr
      1 x  ----basting ingredients----
      5 T  Butter; melted
    1/3 c  Lemon juice
      3 T  Oregano; fresh or 1 tbsp dr
 
  Several hours before serving-or the day before, if time allows, rub
  the chicken pieces pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep
  china or earthenware bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the
  garlic clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate
  the chicken.  Turn chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook,
  preheat the broiler to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces
  on the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted butter
  mixture.  (Reserve part of the basting mixture to serve over the
  chicken when served.)  Broil the chicken 3-4 inches from the heat for
  5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices run
  clear when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove to serving platter,
  pour reserved basting mixture over the chicken breasts and serve
  immediately. This is also good done on a BBQ.
 

 

 
      Title: CHAMPAGNE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned
      2 T  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter
    1/4 c  Champagne; dry
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 T  Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)
      1 x  Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 x  ----optional ingredients----
      6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin
      3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
      1 T  Butter or margarine
 
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
  chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
  large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
  cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
  minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a simmer.
  Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or over
  rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish of
  Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place each
  half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat tenderizer
  until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until tender. Divide
  shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading evenly over
  each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half, fold in half,
  and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes on each side in
  the butter and olive oil listed in the original ingredients. Chicken
  is done when it springs back when lightly pressed with finger. Follow
  the balance of the instructions listed above for the sauce. Source:
  The original recipe came from "The Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet"
  published by Culbertson Winery. The "additional ingredients"
  modification is my own.

      Title: CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPICY SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Peanuts; raw
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2 ea Whole chicken breasts at roo
      1 ea Large egg white
  1 1/2 T  Water chestnut flour
      1 x  -sauce--
      4 ea Green onions
      2 ea Large cloves garlic
      1 T  Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 T  Sesame oil
    1/2 T  Chinese red vingear
    1/2 T  Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 t  Chili paste with garlic
      1 T  Dry sherry
      1 ea Pinch sugar
      1 ea Cornstarch paste
 
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  +++++ Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
  white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in
  2-quart saucepan. Reserve. Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken
  meat from bones.  Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1"
  chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water
  chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg
  beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
  thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a
  lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
  (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a
  light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or
  paper bag. Reserve. Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk
  first:  chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2
  minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry
  no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to
  keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long
  chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:  While deep-frying
  chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions & peanuts about a
  minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken pieces to
  sauce, mix quickly & serve.
 

 

 
      Title: CHICKEN MILANESE
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 ea Chicken breast halves; skin
    3/4 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
      2 T  Parmesan; freshly grated
    3/4 c  Breadcrumbs; fresh white
      1 T  Parsley; minced fresh
    1/8 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Pepper; freshly ground
      1 ea Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 c  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter; unsalted
      2 T  Lemon juice; fresh
      1 ea Lemon; quartered
      1 x  Parsley springs; fresh
 
  Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of
  3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling pin.  Mix cheese, breadcrumbs,
  minced parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in
  medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb
  mixture, coating completely and pressing to adhere.  Shake off excess
  breadcrumbs.  Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add
  chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4
  minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels and drain.
  Transfer chicken to platter. Melt butter in small saucepan. Mix in
  lemon juice and pour over chicken.  Garnish with lemon wedges and
  parsley sprigs. *** My notes:  I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and
  breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I reduced
  the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for 6
  breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
  enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

  topping a tortilla with some of each of the ingredients, ending with a
  dollop of sour cream, and then rolling it up.
  TIME-SAVERS:
  MICROWAVE TIP: Just before serving, stack the tortillas and wrap them in a
  damp paper towel. Cook at 100% for 1 minute.
  DO-AHEAD: Since the fajitas are fine served at room temperature, much of
  the preparation can be done ahead of time. The sauce (Step 5) can be
  made and the chicken marinated in advance. Just be sure to cook the
  chicken and warm the tortillas as close to serving time as possible.

      1 x  Trimmed of fat
 
      In a large bowl, combine the allspice, thyme, cayenne pep- per,
  black  pepper, sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, garlic powder and sugar.
  With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar,
  orange juice, and lime juice.  Add the Scotch bonnet pepper,. onion,
  and green onions and mix well.  Add the chicken breasts, cover and
  marinate for at least 1 hour,  longer if possible.
      Preheat an outdoor grill.
      Remove the breasts from the marinade and grill for 6 minutes on
  each side or until fully cooked.  While grilling, baste with the
  marinade.
      Heat the leftover marinade and serve on the side for dipping.
      NOTE:  This is the recipe as listed in the cookbook.  Per-
  sonally, I would NEVER heat the leftover marinade and serve on the
  side for dipping, especially something that you had marinated POULTRY
  in.  A MUCH better idea would be to reserve some of the marinade
  (BEFORE you put the chicken in it) and save it for serving.
      This recipe is also from Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking by Devra
  Dedeaux.  "This recipe is not as hot as you would find in Jamaica.
  For that authentic flavor, double the quantity of dry spices."

  chicken breasts in seasoned flour -- be careful to
  shake off excess flour -- and place them in the hot
  pan. Saute chicken, for approximately 2 minutes per
  side. Add butter and mango puree to the pan. Cook
  until the sauce is reduced and fairly thick -- about 2
  minutes. With a spatula, remove the mango-covered
  chicken breasts from the pan and place them on a hot
  platter. Spoon remaining mango puree over the chicken.
  Sprinkle with toasted almonds. Garnish each breast
  with 2 mango slices. For a more pronounced mango
  flavour, use fresh mangoes. Use 2 fresh mangoes and
  1/2 cup of orange juice. Boil for 1 minute. From
  owner-chef Barry Pall of Pappacito's, a fast-food
  restaurant in the Bell Canada Tower ind downtown
  Montreal. He refused to identify the spices in the
  seasoned flour but will admit that there are 2
  teaspoons of powdered chicken soup per cup of flour.

      Title: BLACKENED CHICKEN
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     16    3 oz skinless chicken breast

-SEASONING MIX-
      2 T  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Garlic powder
  1 1/2 t  Ground black pepper
      1 t  White pepper
      1 t  Onion powder
      1 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Gound cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Sweet paprika

----OTHER INGREDIENTS----
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter
 
  NOTE: Recipe calls for 16 (3-ounce) skinless boned
  chicken breasts, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, or 8
  (10-ounce) bone-in leg-thigh pieces, or a combination
  of these.  Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then bone each
  piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat
  in one piece.  Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast
  or leg-thigh fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken
  come to room temperature before blackening.
   Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
  small bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over
  very high heat until it is extremely hot and just
  short of the point at which you see white ash or a
  white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8
  minutes.  (the time will vary according to the
  intensity of the heat source.)    Heat the serving
  plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  piece of chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that
  both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each fillet
  evenly with the seasoning mix, using about a rounded
  1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with your
  hands.  (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other
  surface to season it, be sure the surface is warm so
  the butter won't congeal and stick to the surface
  instead of to the meat.  Wipe the surface clean after
  seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning
  mix in another recipe.)
     Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in
  the hot skillet, making sure all meat folds are opened
  up and the meat is lying flat.  Pour about 1 teaspoon
  butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as the
  butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet
  at a time, place each fillet in the skillet before
  buttering and seasoning another one.    Cook uncovered
  over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes.  (The time will vary according
  to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the
  skillet or fire;  watch the meat and you'll see a
  white line coming up the side as it cooks.)  Turn the
  fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon more melted
  butter on top of each.  Cook just until meat is cooked
  through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken
  fillets crustier side up while piping hot.    Clean
  the skillet after cooking each batch and repeat the
  blackening procedure with the remaining chicken
  fillets.    To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1
  leg-thigh fillet on each heated serving plate.  If you
  use a large serving platter, do not stack the fillets.
  Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done
  either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The
  process creates an incredible amount of smoke that
  will set off your own and your neighbors' smoke
  alarms.  People with really well-installed commercial
  hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in
  their own kitchens.  They are privileged!  Don't push
  your luck."

  high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and cook 10
  minutes. Drop heat to low and cook for an additional 30 minutes without
  removing the lid. The crusty rice around the sides and bottom will stick to
  the pan. This will be used in the soup. Take off the top layer of softer
  rice and reserve for another use. Lift out the crusty rice and place on a
  cookie sheet to dry at room temperature, or place in a glass baking dish in
  a microwave oven for 10 minutes on low. If the rice is dried at room
  temperature, allow 12-24 hours before deep frying.
  
  Soup: Toss the strips of chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the
  cornstarch. Set aside. In a small container, combine remaining 2
  tablespoons of cornstarch with water and soy sauce. Heat stock just to
  boiling. Stir in soy mixture and chicken. Simmer 5 minutes. Add the
  shredded greens, onions and sesame oil, if desired. Keep the soup hot (but
  not boiling) while frying rice. Heat oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer or
  heavy saucepan. Fry rice 3 to 5 minutes until puffed and lightly browned.
  Be watchful, because it can burn quickly. Lift rice out of the fat with a
  slotted spoon. Drain the rice on paper towls and place in a heated tureen
  or individual bowls. Pour in the soup. Serve at once. Additional fried rice

  CUT THE CHICKEN BREASTS into fine shreds 3 inches long. Mix them with the
  egg white, salt and cornstarch. Chill for about 20 minutes. Heat the oil in
  a wok or large skillet until moderately hot. Add the chicken mixture and
  stir-fry it quickly in the oil to keep it from sticking. Cook until it
  turns white, which should take about 1 minute. Drain the chicken
  immediately in a colander or sieve and drain off the oil. Clean the wok and
  add about 1 tablespoon of the drained oil. Reheat until it is hot. Add the
  sesame seeds and stir-fry them for 1 minute or until slightly brown. Add
  the sauce ingredients and bring to a boil. Return the cooked chicken to the
  pan and stir-fry the mixture for another 2 minutes, coating the pieces
  thoroughly with the sauce and sesame seeds. Serve at once, or let cool and
  serve at room temperature.

CRISPY EGG LACE
           Oil for deep-frying
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a fork
  and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press
  it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep
  saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper
  bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the
  oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds.
  Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat
  with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it
  at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are
  done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil
  over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1
  minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and
  set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to
  the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add
  tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a
  dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the
  wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3
  to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the
  reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer
  together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture,
  green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through.
  Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently
  crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of
  noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat.
  Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace
  (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.
  
  CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep
  oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a
  medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let
  eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until
  lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular
  lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break
  into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. ---

  (The word Hammin (or Hammim) is derived from the Hebrew adjective Ham or
  warm which describes certain dishes that are kept warm for prolonged
  periods of time...In Pitigliano, however Hammin was the classic one-course
  meal for Passover that both rich and poor used to make. The only difference
  between the versions was the in the cuts of meat used. Poor people used
  breast of lamb..and meatballs made with beef(when the cost of ground beef
  was a fraction of the cost of chicken.) People who didn't have to worry
  about the cost used tiny rib chops from baby lamb and chicken balls."
  
  Combine ground chicken, 1 Tbsp olive oil, egg, matza meal and 2 Tbsp broth
  in small bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix well. In large
  pot, place the lamb with remaining oil, sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and 1/4
  tsp pepper and lightly brown for 2-3 minutes. Add garlic, parsley and 1 cup
  of warm water. Form many tiny bowls with the ground chicken mixture and
  gently add to pot with lamb. Cover and simmer 1 to 1/2 hours. Add spinach
  and 1 Tsp salt and simmer, covered, 15 minutes longer. Transfer the lamb
  chops, half the spinach and most of the gravy to a hot serving dish and
  keep warm. Add remaining broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add matza pieces
  and cook 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and let stand 5 minutes before
  serving as a soup. Serve the lamb and spinach as the main dish. SERVES: 6-8

  Passover Chicken Soup with Rice      *matza meal is available at some
  supermarkets and Jewish grocery stores
  
  "I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the first
  two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our classic soup was a
  chicken soup with rice to which were added balls of chicken breast and
  whole immature eggs (which are still at the stage where the outer shell and
  white have not yet formed; they are perfectly round and vary from less than
  1" to less than 1 mm in diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with
  the white rice, the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens
  raised on private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
  eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.
  
  Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten egg
  with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add ground chicken,
  salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in the refrigerator for
  at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny balls, no larger than the
  egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add rice, chicken balls and cook,
  covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs, discard whites and place one hard
  boiled egg yolk in each of the eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg
  yolks and serve immediately.

      2 tb Butter
     20 oz Frozen spinach
           - thawed and drained
      2 lb Whole-milk ricotta cheese
      2    Eggs; slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped parsley

     16    Halves of chicken breast
           -(order the chicken boned,
           - split, with the skin on)
 
  Saute the onions in butter until soft.  Combine with the other ingredients
  (except chicken) and mix well.  Season highly. Place each breast skin side
  up on a board.  Trim away excess fat.  Loosen skin from 1 side of breast
  and stuff approximately 1/3 cup of the filling under the skin. Tuck the
  skin and meat under breast, forming an even, round, dome shape. Put the
  stuffed breasts in a buttered Pyrex or metal baking dish. Fifteen minutes
  before baking, preheat over to 350 F (175 C).  Bake breasts until golden
  brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Don't overcook or chicken will be dry. Cool
  slightly before serving, and cool to room temperature if you are going to
  slice into smaller serving pieces.  Arrange on platters and decorate with

  flatten to a 3/8-inch thickness. Gently flatten the tenderloins. Lay the
  breasts down on what was their skin side and place about 1/3 cup stuffing
  on each breast, leaving a 1-inch border. Gather up the edges around the
  stuffing as best you can. Lay a tenderloin on the opening and wrap each
  bundle with the skin. Preheat oven to 350F. Place the bundles in a baking
  dish just large enough to hold them comfortably. Pour in Marsala and
  vinegar, cover and place in oven for 20 minutes. Arrange the chicken on a
  platter and pour the cooking juices into a saucepan. Place saucepan over
  high heat and boil until reduced by half. Remove from the heat, pour the

      1 sl Ginger; fresh, diced

      1    Garlic clove; pressed

  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil

    1/2 c  Onion; chopped
      4    Mushrooms; fresh, diced fine
      2    Zucchini; cut into cubes
      1 tb Cilantro; fresh, chopped
           - fine
      1 c  Rice; cooked
    3/4 c  Chicken broth; or as needed
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
           Soy sauce; to taste
 
    Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and 2
  tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while preparing the
  remaining vegetables.
    Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the onions
  until they are limp.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they give up their
  juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve.
    Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to drain
  most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and slightly
  browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3 minutes. Add the
  rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the chicken stock to keep the
  rice from sticking.
    Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the almonds
  and serve immediately.
    Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I very
  often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With cooked
  vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and add them just
  early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not to use vegetables
  that will become mushy with the heating, you will want them to still be
  tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli, even spinach. If you are
  having Denise Bradshaw over to dinner, throw in a few peas.

      Title: CHICKEN BREASTS WITH GREEN CORIANDER (CILANTRO)
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Boneless chicken breasts
      1 bn Baby carrots
      1 bn Coriander (cilantro)
      2 tb Best quality olive oil
      1 ts Lemon juice
 
  Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.  Lay
  each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with the palm
  of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the sides of the
  paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible, and roll up to
  make a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with foil to make a
  waterproof package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.  Measure the olive oil
  into a small saucepan and add a seasoning of salt and pepper.  Coarsely
  chop a tablespoon or two of coriander leaves (a little less for beginners,
  a little more for addicts) and reserve separately.  All these preparations
  can be done well ahead.
      About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
  Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into a
  large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending on the
  size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the surface of the
  liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels, still wrapped up,
  to a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.
      Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.  Warm
  the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2 tablespoons of the
  juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly carve the breasts into
  thin slices and arrange the meat beside the carrots.  Add the lemon juice
  to the hot olive oil and immediately pour the sizzling mixture over the
  chicken and carrots.  Scatter with chopped coriander and serve straightway
  with hot crusty bread to mop up the juices.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 pk Chicken breasts or thighs,
           - boneless (approx 1lb.)
      1 tb Butter or margarine
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
    1/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Sliced mushrooms (opt.)
      1 tb Teryaki sauce
      1    Salt, pepper & chili
           - powder
 
  Melt the butter in an 8" skillet or fry pan, add chicken, salt, pepper and
  some chili powder. When chicken is browned on both sides remove it to a
  plate. Put the cream of mushroom soup in the skillet, add teriyaki sauce
  and milk mixing until soup is smooth. Add more salt, pepper and chili
  powder to taste. Add mushrooms if desired, fresh or canned. Put cooked
  chicken pieces back into skillet until thoroughly warmed and covered in
  sauce. You may need little more milk if you have a lot of chicken. There
  is normally enough sauce to cover the chicken and some for the rice,
  noodles or mashed potatoes served with it. The sauce should have a mellow
  taste not to cover up the chicken but normally has a spicy, warm
  aftershock.
  Preparation Time: Less than 25 minutes.

      Title: ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH CRANBERRY PORT SAUCE
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 12 servings
 
     12 ea Chicken breasts, boneless

----STUFFING----
      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
      3 ea Zucchini, grated and drained
      1 ts Tarragon, dried
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/4 c  Parsley, finely chopped
           Salt
           Pepper, fresh ground

SAUCE
    1/2 c  Port
      1 c  Red wine
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Cranberries, dried
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  To buy boneless chicken breasts with the skin on, purchase chicken breasts
  on the bone and ask your butcher or supermarket to remove the bones but
  leave the skin intact. It is a much more beautiful presentation and it
  keeps the chicken moist. Bones can be used to make stock or discarded. If
  you prefer, or can only obtain skinless chicken, then make a cut on the
  bottom of each breast the length of the breast to form a pocket. Stuff each
  breast with same amount of filling and turn slit side down. Brush top with
  a film of Dijon mustard and continue with recipe. To heighten mushroom
  flavour, add one 10g package of soaked dried mushrooms along with the
  regular mushrooms, if desired. Dried currents may be substituted for
  cranberries. Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Heat butter in skillet on
  medium high heat. Add onion, saute until softened the add mushrooms and
  zucchini. Saute until all liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally,
  about 10 minutes. Stir in tarragon and cream. Continue to cook until cream
  has reduced and mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and
  add enough breadcrumbs to hold mixture together. Add parsely and season
  well with salt and pepper. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
  With fingertips, make a pocket between skin and flesh of each chicken
  breast. Stuff about 1/3 c filling under skin, tucking skin around breast to
  enclose stuffing. Place chicken breasts in large oiled (preferably metal)
  baking dish or roasting pan. Dot with butter, refrigerate until one hour
  before baking. Baking in 400F (200C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until
  juices run clear. If skin is not quite crisp enough, place under broiler to
  crisp it. While chicken is baking, place sauce ingredients in pot and bring
  to boil over medium high heat. Reduce by half, skimming occasionally, about
  25 minutes. Over low heat, whisk in butter, 1 tb at a time, until sauce is
  slightly thickened and glossy. Just before serving, skim any fat off pan
  juices and add juices to sauce. Either slice chicken breasts into 1/4 inch
  slices before serving and coat with sauce or serve chicken breasts whole
  and place sauce in sauce boat. Garnish with extra dried cranberries, if
  desired.
 

 

 
      Title: FESTIVE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry

           - with skin and bones
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
  1 1/2 ts Ginger; ground
    1/2 ts Paprika
      2 dr Hot pepper sauce (or 3)

  glass baking dish and set aside.  In a small mixing bowl, combine soy
  sauce and sugar; add remaining ingredients.  Pour over chicken,
  turning to coat evenly.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for
  several hours or overnight.  Drain and reserve marinade.  Bake at
  325F for 50-60 minutes or until chicken tests done, basting

      Title: PEANUT STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
 Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/8 c  Honey
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Mint, dried
      1 pk G. Washington's Golden
           -bouillon mix
 
  Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as
  possible. (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any
  knifework I've tried to date.)  Pull off shreds and gobbets.
  Put peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.
  Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to
  mix.
  Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over each
  piece of breast meat.  Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on the
  breast and roll them up into a packet.  Tie the packet shut with
  butcher's twine or fasten with a toothpick.
  Arrange the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful
  not to let any fall open.
  Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and mix
  well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets.
  Add water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch.
  Turn crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours.
  Remove packets from pot and let drain on a platter.
  All the chicken fat will have migrated to the top of the liquid,
  which I suspect would probably make a wonderful flavoring for soups
  and other dishes.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Chicken breasts, split in
           - Half and boned
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
           Garlic powder to taste
      1 lb Smoked sausage or kielbasa
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Chopped onion (1 lg)
      1 c  Chopped pepper (1 lg)
      1 c  Chopped celery (2 ribs)
      7 c  Water divided
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Chopped garlic (1 clove)
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
    Season chicken breasts lightly with salt, black pepper and garlic powder.
  If possible, do this the day before you cook the gumbo.  Next slice sausage
  into 1/4-to-1/2 inch pieces.
  
    Make roux, using a cast iron or very heavy skillet that is very clean.
  Place oil in skillet over high heat - oil should be at stage where it just
  begins to smoke - and gradually stir in flour, using a long-handled spoon.
  
    Roux will take about 3 to 4 minutes to cook and must be stirred
  constantly so that it does not burn.  If you see black specks in the roux,
  it has burned and you must start over again.
  
    As you make the roux, it will change in color from cream to tan to brown
  and then to dark red-brown.  Remove from heat.  Stir in onions, green
  peppers and celery, stirring constantly until roux stops getting darker.
  Bring to stove once more, and cook over low heat about five to seven
  minutes, stirring constantly.
  
    In a large dutch oven, bring 6 c of water to a boil, and add the roux,
  stirring to dissolve it thoroughly.  Carefully add chicken and cook about
  30 to 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Remove chicken, and
  set aside to cool.  Debone chicken, and cut into bite-size pieces.
  
    Add sausage, 1 c water, 1 ts black pepper and chopped garlic and cayenne
  to the pot, and simmer for 35 to 45 minutes, uncovered, stirring
  frequently.  Taste, and add salt, if necessary.  Stir in the chicken, and
  remove the gumbo from the heat.  skim surface to remove fat that sausage
  gives off during cooking.
  
    Serve over rice with a tossed salad and French bread.
  
    Note: Excellent.

  Wow, with over a dozen Chinese or Oriental cookbooks, I had a hard time
  finding this recipe! It is probably called something else (like spicy fried
  chicken) and I really do have a dozen recipes.
  :)  This one is from _Elegant_ Entertaining_Cookbook_ by Myra Sable of
  Sable and Rosenfeld, Bantam books.

  AD.

  Heat the oil in a wok. Deep fry the chicken, a few pieces at a time, about
  1 minute or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Pour all
  but 2 TB of the oil out of the wok.
  
  To the oil in the wok, add the chili peppers, garlic and ginger, stir-fry 2
  minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine and 1
  tea cornstarch, mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil and salt. Pour
  into wok, cook, stirring for 2 minutes until thickened.

      Title: CHINESE: CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPICY
 Categories: Main dish, Nuts, Chinese, Ethnic, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 c  Raw peanuts
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Whole chicken breasts at
           -room temp.
      1 lg Egg white
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
           SAUCE:
      4    Green onions
      2 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil
    1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 ts (level) chili paste with
           -garlic
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 pn Sugar
 
  cornstarch paste
  
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white part
  into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan.
  Reserve.
  
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat into
  1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold
  chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single
  chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk). Stir chicken pieces into egg
  mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut flour
  gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be
  substituted.
  
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll
  need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a light tan
  color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts with
  strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.
  
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they are
  frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green onions &
  peanuts about a minute before serving. At the last minute, add chicken
  pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

  an insurance company.  Published in Chicago Tribune Magaine 11/14/93.
  
  [Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see that
  nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices -- other
  than the chili powder (which was not listed in the "ingredients,"
  originally -- I had to go back and insert that)  or what to do with the
  vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices in the cooking oil and
  smear it over the chicken breast before grilling or broiling. Suggestions,
  of course, will be appreciated.  Complaints will be ignored.]

  Slice the chicken into chunks about 1/2 inch square.
   Place them in a large bowl.  Squeeze the lime juice over chicken. Add the
  garlic, scallions, black pepper, and cumin, and toss to mix. Slice the bell
  peppers into strips and set aside. Wrap the tortillas in a thin, clean
  dishcloth, place them on an ovenproof plate, and put the plate in the oven.
  Warm the tortillas at the lowest setting on your oven while preparing the
  fajita mixture.  Heat the oil and water in a large saucepan over medium
  heat and add the chicken, bell peppers, and jalapeno peppers. Add the
  greater amount of jalapeno if you like your food very spicy. Saute,
  stirring frequently, until the chicken and vegetables are cooked through,
  about 25 minutes. Add salt to taste. Spread a spoonful of the fajita
  mixture in a thick line in the middle of each tortilla. Top with cilantro,
  tomato, and salsa to taste. Roll up the tortillas and serve. Makes 4
  servings of 2 fajitas each.
  
  NOTE:  You can buy prepared salsa in the supermarket or you can make your
  own.  See Mexican-Style Hot Sauce recipe.

  Rinse chicken and put in a heavy plastic food bag; add 2 tablespoons
  sherry.  Seal bag; rotate.  Chill at least 30 minutes or up to 6 hours;
  turn over several times.
  
  Meanwhile, thinly slice onions; wrap several slices airtight and chill up
  to 6 hours.  In a 10- to 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, combine
  remaining onion slices, wine, vinegar, and honey.  Stir often until liquid

  tablespoon sherry.
  
  Arrange breasts in a single-layer with marinating liquid in a 9- by 13-inch

  part (cut to test), 12 to 15 minutes.  With a slotted spoon, transfer
  chicken to a warm platter.  Spoon onion mixture over chicken. Garnish with
  reserve onion slices and parsley. Add salt and pepper to taste.

      Title: AL'S CHICKEN SCHNITZEL
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1 kg Chicken Breasts
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Flour
      2 c  Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)
 
  All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and Australian
  currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in half as
  described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs about $10 to
  serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed potato and mini
  carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first Recipe so here goes.
  
  Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet to beat
  chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim any skin or get
  skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories.
  
  Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second
  plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread crumbs
  on it.
  
  Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg either
  by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs and put on
  plate.
  
  On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so that
  the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is very
  soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the cooking for the
  family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or what but they taste
  best that way.Just cook them and when the look cooked cut in half and if
  the meat is white(like chicken sould look not the colour of an uncooked
  fillet) they are cooked.I cook on medium heat in a frypan with some oil.
  Serving Suggestions: In the Colder months this meal is best served with
  Mashed potato and gravy as well as carrots and any other vegetables you
  like.
  
  In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the
  lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin pineapple
  ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a filling and
  tasty meal.
  
  Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated. CYA!

      Title: GRILLED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH MANGO SALSA
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Chicken breast halves,
           -boneless
      2 T  Dark soy sauce
      2 T  Salad oil
      2 T  Honey
      2 T  Fresh, strained lime juice
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Cayenne pepper

--MANGO SALSA--
      2    Mangos (about 1 lb. each) **
    1/2 c  Finely diced red onion
    1/2 c  Cucumbers - see instructions
      2    Peppers, seeded and diced
           Juice of two limes
    1/2 t  Salt

--BASIC-CAPER MAYONNAISE--
      2    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 T  Strained fresh lime juice
    1/4 t  SALT, HEAPING
 
  Cucumbers should be finely dice, unpeeled.-
  
  Trim the chicken breast halves of all fat and gristle and separate the
  tenderloin.  Mix soy, oil, honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a
  shallow dish just large enough to hold the chicken in one close layer.
  Marinate the chicken in this mixture for 1 hour at room temperature or for
  several hours the refrigerator, turning several times.  Grill the chicken
  breasts for 3 to 4 minutes per side, the tenderloins about 2 minutes per
  side.  The chicken may also be sauteed over moderate heat in a skillet
  lightly filmed with oil.  The bottom of the skillet will darken as the
  honey caramelizes but is easily cleaned.
  
  Cut the breasts in thick slices and fan on dinner plates, placing the
  tenderloins along side.  Spoon the salsa over the top and drizzle with the
  mayonnaise.
  
  MANGO SALSA
  
  Slice the mango flesh from each side of the pit.  One half at a time, make
  an inch cut just inside the skin, then score the flesh in 3/8-inch cubes.
  Turn skin inside out and free the mango flesh with the knife. Cut the cubes
  in inch dice, reserving any mushy pieces for some other use. You should end
  up with about 1 1/2 cups. Combine mango with all remaining ingredients and
  let sit 30 minutes to blend flavor.
  
  **  Note:  1 1/2 Cups peach or papaya dice may be substituted for the
  mango.

 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Coconut milk
      6    Thin slices young galangal
      2    Stalks lemon grass,
           ; lower third portion only,
           ; cut into 1" piece, crushed
      5    Fresh kaffir lime leaves
      8 oz Boned chicken breast, sliced
      5 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Lime juice
      1 ts Black chili paste
    1/4 c  Cilantro/coriander leaves
           ; torn
      5    Green Thai chili peppers,
           ; crushed
 
  A rich, aromatic dinner soup, which is enjoyed throughout the meal.
  Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their
  flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a
  knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink shoots.
  Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the flavor will not
  be quite the same.
  
  Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime
  leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling.  Add the chicken, fish
  sauce and sugar.
  
  Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked .  Add the
  remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.
  
  Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the soup
  into the serving bowl.
  
  Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and serve.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place
  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and
  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole
  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the
  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to
  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and
  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.
  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for
  garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper
  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,
  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds. We also served it
  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who
  cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any
  tender, delicate white fish ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or
  maybe little chunks of monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as
  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I
  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,
  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available
  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or
  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok
  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild. I like it
  in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,
  I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the
  slices of lemon grass and ginger.

  Place the chicken, lemon grass and galangal in a soup pot.  Add the water
  and cook over medium for about 30 minutes.  Add the remaining ingredients
  and simmer for 20 minutes.  You may need to adjust the salt, sugar and

  with extra chilis and white rice.

      Title: SMOKED CHICKEN AND PEPPERONI GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Chicken
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           -Spice mixture:
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Dry parsley flakes
    1/2 ts Gumbo file powder
           -(optional)
           -Vegetables:
      2 c  Onion
      2 c  Green pepper
      2 c  Celery
           -meats:
      2    Smoked chicken breasts.
     12    Inches pepperoni.
           -broth:
      6 c  Chicken broth
 
  Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut rest in
  fine chop (or use food processor).
  
  Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and pulled
  into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked chicken, you may
  get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke. I would guess no more
  than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches) pepperoni, cut into
  moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about twice as thick as presliced
  pizza pepperoni usually is)
  
  Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and
  singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,
  stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for about
  5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add spice mixture
  and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry roux. Add the broth
  and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to medium low and simmer for at
  least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender and flavors are merged. About
  5 minutes before serving, add the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture.
  At the same time, add more roux to thicken if desired.
  
  Serve in bowl over lots of rice.
  
  For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese
  cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni. Remove
  all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken pieces.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

      1 tb White wine
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Sesame oil

  In a glass bowl, place chicken pieces. Combine 1 tbls. soy sauce and 1
  tbls. cornstarch. Blend in beaten egg white. Pour over chicken and toss to
  coat well. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.
  
   In a small bowl, combine remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine, and 1
  tsp. cornstarch; mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil and salt.
  
   In a wok heat oil. Deep-fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, about 1
  minute, or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towel. Pour all
  but 2 tbls. oil out of wok. To the wok, add chili peppers, garlic and
  ginger; stir-fry 1 minute.
  
   Pour sauce mixture into wok and cook, stirring, about 1 minute, until
  thickened. Return chicken pieces to wok. Mix well and serve immediately.
  
  I like to serve this with rice and Sauteed Snow Peas and Red Peppers. The
  chicken is spicy hot with the dried chili peppers, so adjust to your taste.
  Enjoy!

      Yield: 6 servings
 
-JUDI M. PHELPS-
      1 lb Boneless, chicken breasts;
           -skinless and trimmed of all
           -fat
    1/2 ts Salt; optional
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 ts Tub-style margarine; canola
           -or corn oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1 cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth; defatted and
           -divided
      2 T  Mild honey
      2 T  Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt; or to taste optional
  1 1/2 c  Cauliflower florets
      1 lg Carrot; peeled and thinly
           -sliced
    1/4 c  ;water
      1 T  Cornstarch
      2 T  Dijon-style mustard
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain white rice
           -uncooked
 
  Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt,
  if desired, and pepper.  In large nonstick, spray- coated skillet, cook
  chicken pieces over medium heat, turning frequently with large wooden or
  plastic spoon, 7-10 minutes or until they begin to brown and are cooked
  through.  Remove and set aside in medium bowl. In same skillet, combine
  margarine, onion, garlic, and 3 tablespoons broth. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring frequently, 6-7 minutes or until onion is tender. If liquid begins
  to evaporate, add a bit more broth. Add honey and lemon juice to pan with
  onions, and stir to combine well. Stir in remaining chicken broth and salt,
  if desired.  Stir in reserved chicken, cauliflower, and carrot. Bring to a
  boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until flavors are
  blended.  Meanwhile, cook rice according to package directions.
  
  Combine water and cornstarch.  Stir into simmering sauce and cook,
  stirring, until thickened.  Stir in mustard.  Simmer an additional 1 or 2
  minutes.  Arrange rice on large serving platter.  Top with chicken and
  sauce.  Or serve individual portions over rice.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I have not tried this dish but cooking cauliflower for 20
  minutes is just too long.  I would advise 10 minutes tops to keep it's
  bright color and not become mushy.

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 T  Sweet butter
      2 T  Chopped scallions
    1/2 lb Button mushrooms, whole
           -or quartered large ones
           -wiped, stems removed
           Salt
           Freshly ground white
           -pepper
      6    Prepared chicken breasts
           -with skin removed,
           -slightly flattened
    1/2 c  Concentrated chicken
           -stock*
      1 ds Lemon juice
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1    Beurre Manie*
      2 T  Finely chopped chives
 
  * Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  These butter-flour balls can be
  made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the refrigerator for 1
  or 2 weeks.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a small flat plate
  and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth paste. Roll the paste
  into a ball. In a small skillet, heat 2 T of butter. Add the scallions and
  cook for 2 or 3 minutes without browning.  Add the mushrooms. Season with
  salt and pepper and cook the mixture over high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes
  to brown the mushrooms lightly. Reserve. Season the chicken breasts with
  salt and pepper and sprinkle them with lemon juice. In a large chicken
  fryer, melt the remaining butter. When it is quite hot, add the chicken
  breasts and cook them for 1 minute on each side.  Cover the pan with
  buttered wax paper and then the pan lid.  Lower the heat and simmer the
  chicken breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the juices run out
  pale yellow when pierced with a fork. Do not overcook or pierce every
  piece.  Immediately remove the chicken breasts to a serving platter. Pour
  the chicken stock into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the stock until
  it is almost a glaze. Add the heavy cream and continue cooking over high
  heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the sauce heavily coats a spoon.
  Add the chives and correct the seasoning. Add the mushroom & scallion
  mixture.  Add the chives and correct the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the
  chicken breasts and serve at once. From "Season Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

  to saucepan with chicken.  Add tomato, tomatillos, chilis, and chicken
  broth.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 - 4 hours.  Add water as
  necessary to maintain the desired consistency.  Add 3 - 4 tablespoon
  cornstarch mixed with water prior to serving to thicken as desired.
  
  Eat from a bowl accompanied with a warm flour tortilla or use it as a
  sauce over chili rellenos, eggs, enchiladas, or just about anything.
  One of my favorite meals is to grill a steak until nice and juicy,
  smother with green chili, sprinkle some grated cheese on top and serve
  with Mexican rice.

  very slowly for an hour. Add the chicken and continue to cook for a further
  45 minutes or till the meat of both birds is really tender. Meanwhile cook
  the mushrooms lightly in the butter. Remove the birds from the stock and
  bone them. Cut the flesh into quite small pieces, mix it with the mushrooms
  and the raisins and spread them over the base of the flan case. Beat the
  eggs with a fork and season with the salt, pepper, and ginger. Add 1 cup of
  the cooking juices and pour over the meat in the flan case. If you want to
  have a lid, roll out the rest of the pastry and cover the flan. Bake it in
  moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes if uncovered, 35 minutes if covered.
  Serve warm with a good green salad.
  For a more 20th century flavor-- double the chicken, leave out the pigeon,
  and substitute 1 oz chopped fried bacon for the raisins.

  flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be
  substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll
  need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a light tan
  color;
  if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts with

  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time.  Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they
  are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon.  Reserve.

  you've seen it on restaurant menus as volcano soup. We show an
  honest-to-goodness Mongolian cooker with a charcoal chimney in the center,
  but any chafing dish or electric skillet will do as well.
  
  What's cooking. Everything on the tray is raw, of course--chunks of
  eggplant, crosscut strips of sirloin, halved mushrooms, thin slices of
  chicken breast, squares of Chinese cabbage, shucked shrimp. Fresh spinach
  to simmer along with the other foods is ready in the big red bowl. The
  broth is chicken bouillon that boasts a faint overtone of ginger.
  Individual bowls of fluffy rice are served at the same time as Hot Pot.
  
  The how-to. You pick out a few choice tidbits at a time and drop them from
  chopsticks, bamboo tongs, or fork into the lazily bubbling broth. In a few
  minutes, fish them out to dip into zesty sauces on your plate, like Peanut
  or Red Sauce, Chinese Mustard or Ginger Soy.
  
  Traditionalists poach eggs in the broth when it has taken on subtle flavor
  from the foods that have simmered in it. At the very last, the hostess may
  ladle the broth as a soup. It's delicious! Dessert? Skip it, or serve a
  fruit bowl and candied ginger with coffee or tea.
  
  Etiquette: Use one set of chopsticks for cooking and fishing out morsels
  from Hot Pot, use a second set for eating. If only one set is provided for
  each guest, simply reverse your chopsticks (large ends down) when you cook
  or help yourself to food.
  
  Oriental Hot Pot
  
  Chinese Mustard Ginger Soy Peanut Sauce Red Sauce Hot cooked rice
  
  Shortly before cooking time arrange the meats and vegetables on large tray
  or platter; use a bowl for spinach. Set out dunking sauces. Provide Bamboo
  tongs, chopsticks or long-handled forks as cooking tools for guests.
  
  Heat chicken broth in electric skillet or chafing dish (or use Mongolian
  cooker-- directions follow). Add bouillon cubes to hot broth and stir to
  dissolve; add monosodium glutamate and ginger. Heat to simmering. For
  cooking have broth barely bubbling. Each Guest picks up desired foods with
  chopsticks or whatever, drops them into the bubbling broth. When his
  tidbits are cooked, he lifts them out and dips into the sauces on his
  plate. Serve with rice. Makes 4 servings.
  
  To use Mongolian cooker, fill chimney of cooker with charcoal and add
  charcoal starter. Pour cold chicken broth into cooker. Cover cooker, then
  light charcoal. When broth is hot, continue as above.

  Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
  sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and green
  peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook until veggies
  are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not browned. Remove from pan
  and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute mushrooms until browned, remove
  and add to rest of the stuff. Last step, saute the chicken until done. Add
  everything else back into the pan, season generously with rosemary and
  oregano. Throwing a little basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems
  dry, add small amounts of either plain chicken broth or a broth & white
  wine mix. If you've added too much liquid, then thicken it with cornstarch.

           -OR- sliced green onions
 
  Combine the vinegar, water, fish sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and dried
  shrimp in a small bowl; mix until well blended and reserve.  In a large
  pot, soak the noodles in enough water to cover.  In a small skillet or pot,
  heat vegetable oil 3/4 to 1 inch deep to 350 degrees, or until a dried rice
  noodle puffs instantly when dropped into the oil.  Deep-fry the basil
  leaves a few at a time, turning them once or twice until they are crisp, or
  40 seconds to a minute; drain on paper toweling.
  
  Bring the noodles to a boil and cook them 2 minutes, or until they are
  almost tender.  Drain and rinse them well, then spread them on paper
  toweling to dry slightly.  Head a wok or large skillet and add about 2 1/2
  tablespoons vegetable oil.  Fry the Serrano peppers about 30 seconds, then
  add the garlic and stir-fry until it is soft.  Add the chicken or pork and
  stir-fry until the chicken is almost opaque throughout or the pork is
  browned.  Stir in the shrimp and the sauce and mix completely. Make a well
  in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs. When they are almost
  set, scramble them evenly.  Add half the noodles, throughly incorporating
  them into the mixture; stir in the remaining noodles and half the bean
  sprouts.  Cook just until the bean sprouts are nearly wilted.
  
  Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter.  Cover one half of them with
  ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts.  Ring the
  noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and garnish the
  top with the fried basil.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP (TOM KA GAI OR KAI TOM GA
 Categories: Soups/stews, Thai, Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place
  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and
  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole
  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the
  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to
  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and
  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.
  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for
  garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper
  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,
  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds.  We also served it
  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who
  cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any
  tender, delicate white fish -- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or
  maybe little chunks of monkfish.  I believe I've had this with shrimp as
  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I
  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,
  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available
  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or
  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok
  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild.  I like
  it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,
  I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the
  slices of lemon grass and ginger.

      Title: SAVORY CHICKEN
 Categories: Mexican, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Or 4 half chicken breasts,
           -boned and skinned,
           Cut into pieces
 
  Savory Chicken is so fast and so good you will just want to stand and eat
  it out of the pan.
  
  (Home Spice Blend: use approximately the measurements below for spices. For
  the spice blend, combine cumin, cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic and onion
  powders, salt and flour.  Increase the spice amounts if you are cooking
  more than 2 1/2 pounds of chicken.)
  
  1  tsp cumin powder 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp crushed thyme 1/2 tsp
  garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp salt 1 Tbs flour 2 Tbs butter 1
  or 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 or 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded, minced 1/2 cup
  to 3/4 cup light beer This recipe doubles easily but don't try to saute the
  chicken all at once. After the chicken is skinned and boned, rub it with
  your home spice blend.  If you get inspired, add another spice. Let the
  spiced chicken sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
  
  Using a heavy 12-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil and add 1 cup of the
  chicken pieces at a time.  Saute over medium heat until golden. Remove to a
  plate.  Saute the rest of the chicken, adding more oil if necessary. When
  all the chicken is sauteed, drain off any excess oil. Put all the chicken
  pieces back in the pan, along with the chiles and garlic and add the beer.
  A great head of steam will rise up the the most wonderful aroma. Quickly
  now, clamp on the lid and turn the heat to low.  Check every 5 minutes and
  turn the chicken in the reducing broth.  Cook for about 15 to 18 minutes.
  If the broth cooks away toward the end of the cooking, just add a
  tablespoon more beer.  At the end you should be left with a nice thick
  glaze.  Push the chicken around the beer glaze so it all gets coated. This
  is about the best taco meat you will ever encounter. Since tacos are filled
  with other things, the recipe above will serve 4 people unless you ate too
  much out of the pan.

  NOTE:  "Peri-peri, the national hot sauce of Zimbabwe, is an ancestor of
  many of our Acadian (and other southern) hot sauces.  It enhances lamb,
  beef and fish as well as chicken, and a splash in the glass makes a mean
  Bloody Mary."

  chicken to the pan- simmering 5 minutes as above.)

     28 oz Ital. tomatoes; with juice
     12    Fresh basil leaves; chopped

    1/2 c  Fresh Parmesan; grated
 
  Earlier in the day, add enough water to the skinned chicken to cover it.
  Poach chicken in simmering water (uncovered) until chicken is no longer
  pink. This will take about 8 minutes. Allow chicken to cool in poaching
  liquid. (I put it in the refrig. rather than leave it at room temp. Cooling
  it in the liquid makes it more tender) Later, remove chicken from poaching
  liquid and chop it into small or bite-size pieces. Save the poaching liquid
  to add to the water you're going to cook the pasta in. In large non-stick
  pan, cook the onion and garlic in heated olive oil until softened. Add hot
  pepper flakes and tomatoes and juice. Cook about 30 minutes over med. heat
  until sauce thickens. Cook penne in poaching liquid with additional water
  as needed. Combine chicken with the sauce mixture in serving bowl. Add
  parsley and cheese. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately. Judy

      1    Inch cubes fried tofu, cut
           -into 1/2-inch slices
           -(optional)
           Big pinch chile flakes
      2    Handfuls bean sprouts,
           -tailed
      2    To 4 tablespoons chicken
           -broth or water, as needed
      4    Green onions, trimmed, cut
           -into 2-inch lengths
           GARNISHES:
      2 tb Coarsely chopped roasted
           -peanuts
           Chile flakes
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
      2    Limes, cut into wedges
 
  Place noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water; let soak about 15
  minutes, or until soft and pliable. Drain; set aside.
  
  Set a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.
  Add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry until shrimp turns bright orange and
  chicken turns white, about 30 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Reheat wok over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and the garlic; brown
  gently (about 20 seconds). Increase heat to medium- high. Add the bean
  sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar; stir until sugar
  dissolves.
  
  Increase heat to high. Break 1 of the eggs into the sauce; beat 3 or 4
  times. Let cook until egg is slightly set but still moist, about 20
  seconds. Repeat with second and third egg. There should be tiny flecks of
  egg peeking through.

  until tender and no longer stiff, about 3 or 4 minutes.
  
  Add the chicken broth 2 tablespoons at a time if noodles seem dry, the
  green onions and the reserved shrimp/chicken mixture; toss for 30 seconds
  to reheat. The sauce is not a wet sauce; it should "dry-coat" the noodles.
  
  Transfer to a platter and serve with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts, chile
  flakes to taste and fresh coriander leaves. Arrange. remaining bean sprouts
  and lime wedges around noodles. (Squeeze lime over noodles before eating.)
  Serve warm or at room temperature.

  rice-flour noodles, labeled "Chantaboon rice sticks."

  In this popular Cantonese teahouse specialty, the rice noodles are
  permeated with an aromatic infusion of curry spices and herbs, seasonings
  borrowed from Indian and Malay cooking-- both cuisines are indigenous to
  Singapore.
  
  Cover mushrooms with warm water. When soft and pliable, remove and squeeze
  dry. Cut off and discard stems. Cut caps into thin slices.
  
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; using chopsticks, stir
  and loosen noodles. When soft and pliable, about 30 seconds, drain them
  into a colander. Cover and let cool.
  
  Preheat wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 slice of the ginger,
  the chicken, shrimp and pork; stir-fry until shrimp and chicken feel firm
  to the touch, about 1 minute. Remove and set aside. Pick out and discard
  ginger.
  
  To hot wok add remaining oil, ginger and salt, crushing ginger against
  sides of wok. When oil is hot, toss in onions, celery, snow peas,
  mushrooms, bell pepper and green onion; stir- fry until tender and crisp (1
  to 2 minutes). Push vegetables to side of wok. Add curry powder to center
  of wok and lightly saute for 10 seconds. Then add sugar, soy sauce and
  chicken stock. Mix.
  
  Add noodles; combine,with vegetables by using chopsticks, to lift, shake
  and separate strands of noodles, until they are evenly coated with sauce,
  moist but not wet and begin to cling to each other. (Add more chicken stock
  if noodles seem too dry). Return meat mix mixture, taste for seasoning.
  Toss to heat through.

      Title: STEAMED BREAST OF CHICKEN WITH BLACK MUSHROOM
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lg Chicken breast
      8    Dried Nami black mushrooms
      2    Green onions
      8    Water chestnuts
      1    Chinese sausage (opt)

----MARINADE----
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2    Slices ginger root/minced
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Thin soy sauce
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  Preparation:  Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 1/2 hour or until soft.
  Remove stems; thinly slice caps. Debone chicken; slice into 1/2" thick,
  quarter-size coins; place pieces in shallow, heat-proof dish. Add marinade
  ingredients to chicken; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Slice water
  chestnuts in thin circles.  Cut green onions on bias into 1" sections.
  
  There are 2 varieties of "Cantonese-style" Chinese semi-dried sausage
  available in Chinese markets: duck liver & sweet pork meat. Either will do
  for this dish. Cut sausage on bias into 1/8" thick slices. Marinade is not
  used with sausage.
  
  Steaming:  Mix sliced mushrooms & water chestnuts with chicken. If desired,
  add sausage. Steam for 20 minutes. If using deep bowl, stir chicken after
  10 minutes to make certain bottom pieces get cooked. Just before serving,
  add green onions. Serve immediately, since cornstarch will become gummy if
  dish is allowed to cool.
  
  HINT: If using metal steamer, stretch dish towel under steamer cover, to
  prevent build-up of condensed steam in dish.

      2 tb Rich chicken stock for paste
      1 tb Dry sherry
    1/4 c  Rich chicken stock
      2    Egg whites
      1 ts Salt
      2    Green onions, minced

  Preparation:  Soak bird's nest in cold water overnight. Drain and rinse.
  Spread softened nest pieces on plate; pick out prominent pieces of
  "foreign" matter (e.g. feathers, twigs) with tweezers. Debone chicken
  breast, remove membrane and muscle fiber, pound meat with cleaver handle to
  break down tissue, mince chicken until it is pulp. Make medium thick paste
  with cornstarch and chicken stock.
  
  Cooking:  Bring rich chicken stock for soup to boil. Immediately add bird's
  nest; simmer 30 minutes. Mix dry sherry and remaining stock; dribble slowly
  into minced chicken. Lightly beat egg whites with a fork; fold gently into
  chicken so they are not completely blended. Add salt to soup. Bring soup
  back to boil and add chicken mixture slowly so soup does not cool. When
  soup returns to boil, it is ready to serve. You can hold it at this point
  on low heat. Pour into serving bowl, garnish with green onions and ham.

      Title: CHEESE FONDUE, AMERICAN STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           ****FONDUE****
      4 cn Campbell's Cheddar cheese
           Soup, undiluted
      1 lb Cheddar cheese sharp, grated
      5 x  Cloves fresh garlic
           Or 1tbsp. garlic powder
      2 tb Kirsch or cherry brandy
           ****DIPPERS****
           FRENCH BREAD
           Ham
           Shrimp
           Smokie links
           Cocktail wieners
           ****DIPPERS****
           Hot dogs
           Smoked sausage
           Turkey, chicken breast
           Turkey ham
           Broccoli
           Cauliflower
           Carrots
           Mushrooms
           Brussel sprouts
           Cherry tomatoes
           Celery stalk
           Radishes
 
  Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
  grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
  freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
  small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
  while stirring.
  FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your area, if not,
  any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at 350 degrees
  for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces. It's best
  when crusty.
  MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized pieces any or all of
  these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail wieners, smoked sausage,
  turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham, hot dogs.
  VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or else the
  pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the pot.... or
  raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,
  mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk, radishes.
  VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's Nacho cheese
  dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for regular
  cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalapeo peppers to
  the cheese mixture for extra zest.
  SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall
  day for lunch, or a freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts
  during a gentle spring rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne
  or wine. Best mood is created if candles are lit and a fire is
  blazing in the fireplace.
  Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
  heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
  fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
  sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
  so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
  years). Enjoy!

    1/2 lb Mixed vegetables
      4    Small red chile peppers
    1/2    Stalk lemon grass
      2    Kaffir lime leaves
      2 tb Oil

      2 tb Fish sauce
     15    Basil leaves

  minutes.  Stir in coconut milk and cook for two minutes.  Add chichen (or
  vegetables) and cook for five minutes of until cooked.  Reduce heat to

      Title: GAENG KIOW WAHN GAI (GREEN CHICKEN CURRY)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Chicken Breast
      2    Chicken Thighs
    1/2 c  Coconut Cream
    1/4 c  Green Curry Paste
      3 c  Coconut Milk
  1 1/2 c  Diced Eggplant
      2 tb Fish Sauce
      1 tb Palm or Brown Sugar
    1/2 ts Coriander leaves
    1/2 c  Basil leaves
      3    Red chilis
 
  1. Bone and skin the chicken breast and thighs, you should have about
     1lb of meat. Cut the meat into large, bite sized pieces, and set
     aside.
  
  2. In a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan, warm the coconut cream over a
     medium heat until it boils gently. Adjust the heat to maintain a
     gentle boil and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
     The coconut cream will become fragrant as it thickens. When you
     see tiny pools of oil glistening on the surface add the curry paste
     and stir to dissolve it into the coconut cream. Continue cooking for
     1 to 2 minutes, until the curry paste has a pleasing aroma.
  
  3. Add the chicken pieces and stir fry for 1-2 minutes to coat them
     evenly with the paste. Cook for about 2 minutes. Increase the heat
     and add the coconut milk, eggplant, fish sauce, sugar and salt and
     stir well. Stir in the coriander, adjust the heat to maintain a gentle
     active boil and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste
     and adjust the seasoning with a little more fish sauce, sugar, or curry
     paste.
  
  4. When the chicken is done, and the eggplant is just tender, remove from
     the heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter basil leaves, chopped
     chillis and some coriander on the top. Serve.
  
  Preparation in advance:
  
  Prepare it up to the point where you add the coriander, except *DO NOT* add
  the eggplant. Cool to room temperature, cover, and refridgerate for up to
  24 hours. To serve bring the curry back to a gentle boil over a medium
  heat. Add the eggplant and carry on with the normal instructions from
  there.
  
  An alternative to the eggplant is Snow Peas. I personally prefer them, but
  both work well.

           -thighs, deboned, or
           -boneless chicken breasts
      2 c  Soya Oil
      1 t  Sesame oil
           Water chestnut flour(Powder)
           -to coat chicken pieces

-SEASONINGS (MIX IN BOWL-
      1 tb Ginger Root, minced
      2    Scallions, chopped
      1 tb Garlic, minced
      2    Thai finger peppers, crushed
           -use more or less to taste
      1 tb Orange or lemon peel, minced

----SAUCE (MIX IN BOWL----
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Soy Sauce
  1 1/2 t  Vinegar
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Chicken Stock

----MARINADE----
      1 ea Egg White
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Soy Sauce
 
  This recipe is a combination of the best parts of many other General
  Tso's Chicken recipes I have seen. I use this recipe on a regular
  basis.
  I have used de-boned chicken thighs with good success. Have made it
  using orange or lemon peel and liked it with either. Have used small
  Vidalia onion in place of scallions also.
  Be careful when using the water chestnut flour, it doesn't brown as
  much as regular flour, so don't overcook. The sauce will make the
  dish darker. I tried using a deep fryer for cooking the chicken
  without success. The chicken kept sticking to the fryer basket. Have
  found that using a wok and cooking about 5 pieces of chicken at a
  time works better for me.
  Cut the chicken into pieces no larger than 1" square. Prepare
  marinade by combining egg white, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon soy
  sauce in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces and set aside for two
  hours. In a deep pot, heat the oil until it reaches 350 degrees.
  Dredge marinated chicken pieces in water chestnut powder to coat. In
  a basket, or with a slotted spoon, lower several marinated chicken
  pieces into the fat. Fry about one or two minutes or until the
  chicken becomes crisp; test for doneness before completing the batch.
  Continue until all pieces have been fried. Set oil and cooked chicken
  pieces aside. In a wok, on high heat, reheat two tablespoons of the
  reserved oil. Add prepared ginger, scallions, garlic, chili peppers,
  and orange or lemon peel. Stir to prevent burning. Add the fried
  chicken and stir quickly.Add sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and cornstarch
  mixed with chicken stock. Remove from the heat and stir sesame oil
  into the sauce. Spoon the mixture on to a hot platter and serve
  immediately with steamed rice. Serves 4.

      Title: LEMON CHICKEN WITH BASIL
 Categories: Chicken, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Chicken breasts
      1 lb Mushrooms
      1    Lemon, sliced into thin wedg
      1 c  Tomato sauce-8 oz
      1    Basil; chopped fresh
      6    Sprouts
           Chives; chopped
    1/4 c  White wine-cheap
    1/2 c  Mozarella cheese, shredded *
      1 c  Rice, uncooked
           Parmesan cheese.
 
  Chicken breasts can be split to 4 pieces or cubed to bite size. In
  deep fry pan, saute chicken and mushrooms in half of the white wine
  with basil, lemon, and chives until mostly done. Splash in rest of
  wine (or extra) as needed.  Add tomato sauce, cover, and simmer for
  20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. When done,
  lemon wedges should be thoroughly cooked, and can be eaten.  Serve
  over steamed rice. Top with a sprinkle of parmesan or mozarella (not
  too much) and a little sprinkle of chives. (It's good without the
  cheese, too.) Garnish with a fresh sprig of basil and wedges from
  unused half of lemon. Serves 2 (plenty). NOTE: The white wine can be
  replaced with apple juice. As a matter of fact, I like mushrooms
  cooked in apple juice until it's reduced down to almost nothing. A
  lot less calories than cooking them in butter, and tastes great.
  Sometimes I'll put in a clove of garlic. (I haven't tried this when
  using apple juice instead of wine yet.) D PILEGGI (TDJR42A) Recipe:

      2    To 3 garlic clove
           -- peeled & finely chopped
      2 tb Fresh ginger
           -- peeled & finely chopped
      4 tb Fresh tarragon; chopped

           Vegetable mirepoix
      1 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Whipping cream
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  To prepare chicken breasts, place between sheets of waxed paper.
  Gently pound with a mallet until flat and tender.  Sprinkle each with
  salt, pepper and lemon juice.  Keep covered in refrigerator.
  
  To make stuffing, combine ham, garlic, ginger, half the tarragon and
  about 2/3 of the lemon zest in a bowl, blending well.  Add a dash of
  lemon juice or wine to moisten.
  
  To stuff breasts, place equal amounts of filling on center of each.
  Bring sides up to encase filling, shaping with your hands into a
  round package and tucking in ends to seal.  Greasy the shiny side of
  six, foot-long strips of foil, about 2 inches wide.  Encircle each
  breast with foil, greased side in, pulling tightly so that foil wraps
  around breast. (This retains shape during baking.)  Fold over edge on
  top to secure foil. Brush tops of chicken with butter.  Sprinkle with
  salt, pepper and a little tarragon.  Can be refrigerated, covered at
  this point, if baking is to be done several hours later.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Place the vegetable mirepoix in bottom of a
  large baking dish.  Place chicken breasts on top of vegetables. Pour
  enough wine around bottom of pan just to cover mirepoix. Bake 10 to
  12 minutes, then turn heat down to 350 degrees. Baste chicken. Cover
  pan loosely with foil and bake another 15 minutes or until chicken
  breasts are done but still moist inside. Remove foil covering from
  pan; turn broiler on to brown chicken tops, about 2 minutes.
  
  Remove pan from oven.  Place chicken on heated platter and keep warm;
  carefully remove foil strips.  Meanwhile, remove and discard mirepoix
  vegetables from roasting pan.  Place pan on top of stove.  Remove any
  surface fat and bring to a boil.  Add chicken stock and cream and
  reduce over high heat, stirring until of desired consistency.  Taste
  and adjust seasonings.
  
  To serve, garnish chicken breasts with remaining lemon zest and
  tarragon. Place a little sauce on a heated plate, then place chicken
  breast on top.
  
  Good served with rice-stuffed tomatoes.
  
  Serves 4 to 6, depending upon size of chicken breasts.
  
  Note:  Mirepoix means aromatic vegetables (carrot, celery and onion)
  chopped and placed in the bottom of a roasting pan).
  
  Most of this dish can be prepared in advance.

      Title: CHICKEN SOUP WITH GALANGAL (KAI TOM KHA)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Stalks lemon grass
      1 c  Water
      4 c  Coconut milk
      8    Chicken thighs or
  1 1/3 lb Chicken breast, diced
     10 sl Galangal
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 sm Fresh chilies
      3    Bergamot leaves
      2 tb Lemon juice

----GARNISH----
           Spring onions, shredded
           Chilies, shredded
 
  This one's a bit more complex and gets into some exotic ingredients.
  All of them should be available from an Asian grocery.  If you have
  any questions about what the ingredients are or how to use them, just
  ask. The only thing that can not be substituted for is the fish
  sauce.  You could use ginger instead of galangal, but the soup would
  lack the perfumed, exotic aroma of the galangal that adds so much to
  the dish.
  
  Lime zest could be used for the bergamot leaves.
  
  Cut the lemon grass into 1-inch pieces.  Bring the water to the boil
  with half the coconut milk.  Then add the chicken, lemon grass,
  galangal and 1 tablespoon fish sauce.  Simmer for about 20 minutes or
  until the chicken is cooked.  Less cooking time will be required for
  diced chicken breast.
  
  Stir in the remaining coconut milk and turn up the heat.  As soon as
  it begins to boil, toss in the whole chilies and bergamot leaves.
  Stir, and remove from the heat.
  
  Serve in individual bowls.  Sprinkle each with lemon juice and fish
  sauce to taste and garnish with slivers of spring onions and chili.

      Title: CHICKEN SOUP WITH LEMON AND GINGER (KAI TOM KHING)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
     12 oz Chicken breast, diced
      4 c  Water
      4 oz Straw mushrooms, chopped
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 sm Green chilies, sliced in
           -rings
      2    Spring onions, chipped
      1 pn Ground ginger

----GARNISH----
           Coriander leaves
 
  Here's another simple recipe.  Straw mushrooms are available canned
  in the Oriental section of many supermarkets or fresh in Asian
  groceries. Enoki mushrooms would probably be a good substitute,
  although I haven't tried that...
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan or wok and fry the garlic until soft but
  not brown.
  
  Add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes. cool a little. Add the
  water and mushrooms.  Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
  Add the lemon juice.  Cover, and cook gently for a further 10 minutes.
  
  Add the chilies, spring onions and ginger.  Remove from the heat.
  Sprinkle with coriander leaves before serving.

      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme, divided
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary,
           -divided
      2    Cloves garlic, minced,
           -divided
    1/4 ts Coarsely ground black
           -pepper, divided
      4    6-ounce boneless, skinless
           -chicken breast halves
      4 tb Plus 1 1/2 teaspoons olive
           -oil, divided
    1/4 c  Chopped shallots
      1 c  Marsala wine
      1 c  Homemade or canned chicken
           -broth
  2 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
    1/2 c  Sun-dried tomatoes,
           -julienned
    1/2 c  Sliced green onions
  1 1/2 c  Butter, cut into small
           -pieces (3 sticks)
 
  In a small flat dish, sprinkle half the oregano, thyme, rosemary,
  garlic and black pepper.  Place the chicken breast halves in a single
  layer on top of the herbs.  Pour 4 tablespoons olive oil over the
  chicken. Sprinkle the remaining herbs, garlic and pepper over the
  chicken breasts. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
  overnight.
  
  While chicken is marinating, prepare the Marsala reduction.  In a
  saucepan, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.  Add shallots and saute
  until tender. Add the Marsala and chicken broth and stir to scrape up
  any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring to a simmer and
  cook until reduced by half. Skim off excess fat and strain to remove
  shallots.  Set aside.
  
  Grill or broil chicken breasts for about 7 to 8 minutes per side or
  until done.  While the chicken is cooking, preheat a saute pan.  Add
  the Marsala reduction, mushrooms, tomatoes and green onions.  Bring
  to a simmer and reduce by half.  Remove from heat and stir the butter
  into the sauce bit by bit, stirring constantly, until the sauce is
  slightly thickened.
  
  Serve the chicken breasts topped with the sauce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: GAI TOM KHA (THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Medium coconut milk
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      3 qt Pieces dried galangal
           -(kha), or
      6 qt Pieces fresh galangal
      4    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -bruised, cut into 2-inch
           -lengths
      6    Fresh Serrano chiles,
           -sliced into rounds
      1 lg Whole chicken breast *
      4 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      5    Fresh Kaffir lime leaves
           -(makrut), if available
      2    Fresh limes, juice
      2 tb Chopped coriander leaves
 
  *  cut into 1/2-inch pieces (with or without bones, see note)
  
  Combine coconut milk, chicken stock, galangal, lemon grass and 4 of
  the chiles in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for 20 minutes.  Strain stock; discard galangal and lemon grass.
  Return stock to a boil, add chicken and simmer until tender, about 2
  minutes.  Add fish sauce, citrus leaves and remaining chiles.  Stir
  in the lime juice. Garnish with coriander.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.
  
  NOTE:  I like to use boned chicken breast if I'm cooking for guests.
  For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
  small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
  is tender.

      Title: JELLYFISH, DAIKON AND CHICKEN BREASTY SALAD
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried, salted whole
           -jellyfish
      1    1-pound daikon radish
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 lg Chicken breast
    1/2    Egg white
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Dry sherry
      3 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Sesame oil
      3    Scallions, chopped
 
  Here's a classic Chinese "texture" dish, a cold salad made of with
  dried jellyfish.  I know jellyfish sounds bizarre, but, after
  soaking, the jellyfish has a texture similar to woodears-crunchy and
  crisp with little taste of its own.  I consider the addition of the
  chicken to be a sop to those who like to see recognizable things in
  their food...
  
  Actually, this would probably be quite good with just the chicken or
  just the jellyfish.  It has a light dressing made of mixed oils and
  wine. Very nice on a hot summers day.  More than likely, you'll have
  to go to a Chinese market to get the jellyfish.  This is another
  recipe from my huge pile of clippings.  It's from the SF Chronicle,
  but I don't know the date.
  
  Soak the jellyfish in a large bowl of cold water for 24 hours,
  changing the water a couple of times.  Peel the daikon with a
  vegetable peeler; slice thinly; stack slices and cut into matchstick
  shreds.  Put into a mixing bowl, toss with the 2 teaspoons of salt
  and let stand 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, drain water from jellyfish.  Pour boiling water over the
  jellyfish and let stand for 15 seconds.  Drain and run under cold
  water. Set aside.
  
  Bone the chicken breast and slice thinly; cut slices into shreds. Mix
  chicken with the egg white, cornstarch and teaspoon of sesame oil;
  refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  While the chicken is marinating, cut jellyfish into the thinnest
  possible shreds by rolling up each sheet and slicing it thinly.
  Place in a large bowl.  Wring most of the moisture from the daikon
  shreds; add to the bowl with the jellyfish.  Heat 3 cups water in a
  saucepan.  When boiling, turn off the heat and add the chicken
  shreds, stirring to separate the pieces. Simmer for 1 minute.  Drain
  and rinse under cold water. Drain and add to the bowl with the
  jellyfish.
  
  Blend the salt and sugar with the wine until they dissolve.  Heat the
  oils in a saucepan and add the seasoned wine.  It will sputter and
  evaporate. When the oil is hot++don't let it smoke++turn off the heat
  and add the scallions.  Cool.  Toss with the salad just before
  serving.

     50 g  Diced tomato
     10 g  Chopped truffle
     10 g  Chopped chives
 
  This looks pretty tasty++lamb fillets stuffed with minced chicken and
  served with potato pancakes.  The presentation looks like something
  seen through a kaleidoscope++overlapping triangles formed by the
  three lamb fillets, the potato pancakes, the morels and the sauces.
  Here again, I believe that "shallots" are in reality scallions.  The
  "pork net" is more than likely a web of caul fat.

  To prepare: 1. Soak morels over night in cold water and wash
  thoroughly Discard stalks. 2.  Cut off and discard lamb fillet's
  stringy part. Season fillet with salt and pepper.  Using barbecue
  skewers, pierce through fillet lengthways, stretching meat apart
  slightly to form a central hole about 1.5 cms wide. Stuff chicken
  force meat into hole (one way is to use a piping or icing bag). 3.
  To make port wine sauce:  either make a beef stock which includes
  sauteed mixed vegetables, herbs (rosemary, thyme and black pepper)
  and tomato paste, or liquefy the contents of a gravy sauce packet to
  produce a thick 1/3 cup of gravy.  Add port wine, maintaining a thick
  consistency. Keep warm. 4.  To make chive cream sauce: saute chopped
  shallots in a little oil, add Madeira wine, few drops of white wine,
  and chicken stock.  Boil until thick, then add cream. Strain and add
  chopped chives, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper according to
  taste. Keep warm. 5.  Make 12 small golden-brown potato pancakes.
  Keep warm.
  
  To cook: 1. Saute morels in butter, with seasoning (salt, pepper and
  chicken stock, according to taste) for 2 to 3 minutes. 2.  Lightly
  blanch broccoli florets, then discard stalks.  Saute florets in
  butter with seasoning (salt, pepper and chicken stock, according to
  taste) for 1 to 2 minutes. 3.  Cut stalks off lettuce and blanch
  leaves.  Wrap one layer of lettuce leaves around stuffed lamb.  Then
  wrap it completely with sheet of pork net, folding net over the ends
  to enclose them. 4.  Pan-fry stuffed lamb in melted butter (a
  soupspoonful) over a low flame for approximately 5 minutes until
  lightly browned. 5.  Remove lamb to a roasting dish and roast in its
  own juices in an oven (250F) for 20 to 25 minutes, turning it every 4
  or 5 minutes. 6.  When lamb is cooled, remove from oven, and
  carefully take off pork net wrapping.  Slice the lettuce-wrapped
  fillet into 12 portions.
  
  To present: 1. Dress centre of each plate with a large spoonful of
  chive cream sauce. 2.  Spoon out three separate portions of port wine
  sauce so that they touch the chive cream sauce. 3.  Lay lamb slices
  sideways on port wine sauce. 4.  Place three potato pancakes in
  spaces between lamb slices and lay a broccoli floret on each pancake.
  5.  Garnish chive cream sauce with morels and a central heap of diced
  tomato.  Scatter a few specks of truffle over each lamb slice, and a
  sprinkling of chopped chives over central garnish display.

  noodles depending on where you find them.  All the Asian cuisines
  that I've encountered have some variation of them.  Use the thinnest
  you can find. Other kinds of noodles won't work.  When they hit the
  hot oil, they kinda go "whooosh" and double or triple in size and
  turn a milky white. Kids really like to watch the process.  The oil
  MUST be fresh and hot (375F to 400F) or the centers may be tough.
  
  This recipe makes enough for 6-8 people.  I'd recommend halving it
  for less than that.  It's a sweet/sour dish with the emphasis on the
  sweet. Very tasty and rich.

      1 lg Plump chicken breast
    1/2 c  Celery (tops and tender,
           -inside stalks)
    1/2 md White onion
      2    Or 3 peppercorns
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Red pepper
      1    Yellow pepper
  1 1/2 lg Red onions
    1/2 c  Chopped cilantro leaves

           Pepper to taste

--BEAN FILLING--
      1 lb Bag of pinto beans (red or
           -pink)
      8 c  Water
           Salt to taste
    1/4    Onion
    1/4 c  Olive oil
 
  Poach chicken with celery tops, onions and peppercorns.  Cook for
  about 15 minutes.  Let cool and remove skin.  When chicken is
  skinned, slice or shred, then saute with olive oil in wok or large
  skillet until barely browned around the edges.  Next add red and
  yellow peppers and red onions. Toss and saute for about 10 minutes.
  Watch closely so that peppers don't go limp.  Add cilantro leaves.
  Remove from heat.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Combine with beans
  (see below).  Place in tortillas, top with salsa and serve.
  
  Cook beans in water for approximately 1 1/2 hours on medium heat.
  
  Make sure that beans are completely covered in water.  Stir
  occasionally. Beans will absorb liquid and become soft.  Add more
  water if needed.  Add salt when beans are thoroughly cooked.  Remove
  from heat.  Add chopped onion.  (Onions will cook from the heat of
  the beans.) Drizzle with olive oil.  Let sit.
  
  TORTILLAS: Warm six large flour tortillas in microwave on high (in
  large zip lock bag to preserve moisture) for about 30 seconds.
  
  SALSA: Two large, peeled and chopped tomatoes.
  
  Serves 4.

  Foods wrapped in dried lotus leaves become infused with an exotic
  earthy flavor.  If lotus leaves are not available, you can wrap the
  rice filling in oiled parchment.  Besides being an unusual appetizer,
  this dish can be served as a snack, for lunch, or as a light meal.
  Note that the first step must be done the night before.  Because
  lotus leaves vary so much in size, eight packets may require anywhere
  from four to ten leaves. (Larger leaves can be split in half, smaller
  leaves may need to be overlapped.)
  
  1.  The night before, pour boiling water over the lotus leaves and
  let them soak for 1 hour.  Rinse and squeeze them dry.  Mix the long-
  grain and glutinous rice together in a large bowl.  Wash the rice
  under running cold water; gently stir and rub the grains between your
  fingers to loosen all the excess starch.  Continue until the water
  runs clear. Drain thoroughly. Mix the rice with the chicken stock in
  a 2-quart saucepan; soak overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  2.  The next day, set the saucepan of rice uncovered over high heat;
  bring to a boil.  Stir just enough to loosen the rice grains.  Reduce
  the heat to medium-high and boil until the liquid is absorbed, about
  8 to 10 minutes. Put the sausages on top of the rice and cover the
  pan.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes.  Turn off the
  heat but do not remove the cover.  Let the rice stand for 10 minutes,
  then, with a wet wooden spoon, transfer it to a large bowl; set aside.
  
  3.  Squeeze the mushrooms dry.  Cut off the stems at the base and
  discard them; cut the caps in half.  Combine the marinade ingredients
  in a medium bowl.  Cut the chicken breast into 3/4-inch chunks and
  toss it with the marinade.  Add the mushrooms and marinate for 20
  minutes.  Drain and coarsely chop the shrimp.
  
  4.  In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, and
  sesame oil; mix into the cooked rice.  Add the chicken-mushroom
  mixture and the shrimp.
  
  5.  Fold a lotus leaf in half and put it on a cutting board.  If the
  middle stem or edges are tough and hard, trim and discard them.  (If
  the leaves are small, you may need to over- lap halves.) Divide the
  rice mixture into 8 portions; place one portion in the center of a
  leaf half. Fold the edges over the rice to make a 4-inch square
  packet.  Tie it with twine. Repeat with the remaining leaves and
  rice.  Arrange the packets in a single layer in a bamboo steaming
  basket.
  
  6.  Prepare a wok for steaming.  Steam the packets over medium-high
  heat for 20 minutes.  Remove them from the steamer and cut each
  packet across the top to expose its contents.  Serve with small
  dishes of soy sauce for dipping.
  
  NOTE:  Sweet glutinous rice is also known as "sticky rice" because
  when it is cooked it becomes sticky.  It is used to make poultry
  stuffing and leaf-wrapped rice packages; it is called sweet rice
  because it is often used to make sweet dishes.  Soak it overnight
  before cooking for the best results.
  
  Makes 8 packets.

      Title: THAI GLASS NOODLES (YAM WOON SEN)
 Categories: Thai, Pasta, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 oz Dried mung bean noodles
      1 tb To 2 tb vegetable oil
      1    Whole chicken breast,
           -boned, skinned and
           -coarsely chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Fresh red or green chile,
           -chopped
      3 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
      1 ts Sugar
      3    Shallots, peeled, thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves
      6 oz Cooked bay shrimp
           Shredded lettuce
      1 tb To 2 tb crisp-fried shallots
           -(optional)
 
  This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the
  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With
  this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than
  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when
  buying.
  
  Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.
  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add
  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook
  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a
  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch
  lengths.
  
  Chill.
  
  Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it
  loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt
  and pepper to taste.  Cool.
  
  Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and
  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp
  and chilled noodles; mix well.
  
  Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp
  fried shallots.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.
  
  As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make.  Just
  fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and
  crisp.  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in
  the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor
  accent. Good stuff!

  This looks like a nice dish++chicken breast stuffed with wild rice,
  some veggies and crepe strips to fill in for noodles.
  
  Establishment: Hotel Riverside Plaza Tai Chang Kiu Road, Shatin, New
  Territories. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hot entree
  Chef: Chan Chi-hung Philip (Hotel Riverside Plaza)
  
  To prepare: 1. Precook wild rice as a pilaf with chopped onions,
  chicken stock, and appropriate amount of water. When cool, add grated
  Parmesan cheese and let mixture cool.
  
  2.  Cut chicken breast portions butterfly style (i.e. slice in half
  and spread open.  Flatten and slightly stretch them (by gently
  pounding them between two sheets of wax paper or inside a clean
  plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  3.  Lay a cone-shaped portion of rice stuffing on one side of each
  flattened breast.  Roll chicken breast up in a cone shape.  Wrap each
  cone firmly in aluminum foil (to maintain shape during cooking:  the
  professional recipe calls for plastic foil wrapping, but aluminum
  foil is recommended for home cooking).
  
  4.  Blanch green leek stems, then refresh in cold water.
  
  5.  Make 4 very thin crepes about 20 cms wide (ingredients not
  included above).
  
  To cook: 1. Blanch pearled vegetables, celery and peas, then saute in
  approximately 10 g butter, adding salt and pepper according to taste.
  Keep a quarter aside.
  
  2.  To make sauce, reduce chicken stock and add fresh cream.  Cook
  briefly, then strain.  Add fresh lemon juice and finish with butter
  as required. Adjust seasoning and add chopped chervil according to
  taste.
  
  3.  Saute morels in approximately 10 g butter.
  
  4.  Heat some chicken stock (5 cups should be sufficient to completely
  cover the four wrapped chicken portions).  Simmer breasts in hot
  stock for approximately 7 minutes.  Remove from pan, discard aluminum
  foil wrappings, and saute in approximately 60 g butter until lightly
  browned. Then slice each into six portions, cut at an angle (30 to 40
  degrees).
  
  To present: Treasure Hunt takes the form of a chicken breast "boat",
  with morel oars being rowed towards crepe "treasure bag" of vegetable
  "precious stones" some of which have spilled on the shore.
  
  1.  Portion out 3/4 of vegetable pearls, celery and peas onto crepes
  lifting crepe edges upwards to form bag shapes.  Tie tops of bags with
  blanched green leek stems (with decorative knotted bows if stems are
  long enough).
  
  2.  Pour sauce onto plates.  Arrange chicken slices in a line on
  sauce, lay thick ends of morels between them.  Place a crepe bag on
  each plate, with reserved vegetable pearls laid beside bag.  Garnish
  with chervil sprigs (or watercress or parsley).

      1 c  Cooked shrimp
      1 ts Chopped red chile
  1 1/2 tb Thai fish sauce
  1 1/2 ts Sugar

           -for garnish

----CRISPY FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES----
      6    Shallots, thinly sliced
      1 c  Vegetable oil
 
  It's almost Chinese New Year and the stores are all stocking up on
  fresh fruits which are a traditional Chinese gift for the season.
  Pomelos are a big citrus fruit much like grapefruit, but somewhat
  drier and sweeter. This Thai recipe makes use of them and you should
  be able to find them this time of year.  If not grapefruit will do.
  This is from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 1/30/91, by
  Joyce Jue.
  
  Peel and separate pomelo or grapefruit into segments.  Remove the
  membranes.  Seed.  Gently flake the flesh apart into a bowl.  Chill.
  Hand shred the chicken.  Add chicken and shrimp to pomelo.
  
  In a small bowl mix together the chopped red chile with fish sauce,
  sugar, lime juice and coriander; toss with pomelo chicken mixture.
  
  Arrange the lettuce on a serving platter.  Put the fruit mixture over
  the lettuce.  Top with peanuts and 2 tablespoons of Crisp Fried
  Shallot Flakes, and garnish with red chile slivers.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as a salad entree.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure
  they are all of the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan
  with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly
  until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the
  shallots should be completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel. Store
  in an air-tight container.  Will keep several weeks.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Chicken breast halves
      6    Chicken thighs
           Salt
           Pepper
      2 T  Butter
      2 T  Oil

      4 sm Carrots, cut into 1/2"
           -diagonal slices (~1 1/2 c)
      2 c  Broccoli florets
  1 1/2 c  Quartered button mushrooms
           Rich pastry crust
      2    Egg yolks, beaten
 
  This refined version of an old American classic has a rich, flaky,
  meaty-tasting crust, thanks to its mixture of lard and chicken fat.
  The latter is a handy byproduct of the precooking of the chicken the
  day before. Make sure the chicken fat is good and cold when making
  the crust.
  
  Season chicken parts to taste with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons
  butter and oil together in soup pot. Add chicken and brown. Add
  chicken broth, quartered onion, celery chunks and carrot chunks and
  bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender, 20-30
  minutes. Let cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Next day, skim cold chicken fat off top of broth. Reserve 1/4 cup fat
  for making Rich Pastry Crust. (Keep reserved chicken fat in
  refrigerator.)
  
  Heat broth and remove chicken. Skin and bone chicken parts. Discard
  skin and bones. Cut meat into 2" chunks and set aside.
  
  Strain broth. Reduce over high heat to 3 cups. Combine 1/4 cup melted
  butter and flour in saucepan and gradually stir in broth. Bring to
  boil and boil 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in
  tarragon.
  
  Cook pearl onions, potato, sliced carrots and broccoli separately in
  boiling water until tender, 5-10 minutes each. Drain.
  
  Toss together cooked chicken, cooked vegetables and mushrooms. Stir in
  chicken-tarragon sauce. Divide into 4 (2 cup) oval casseroles.
  
  Make Rich Pastry Crust. Divide dough in half and gather into 2 small
  flattened rounds. Roll first half on lightly floured board to 1/4"
  thick Cut dough to fit tops of 2 casseroles, leaving enough dough to
  overhang edges by 1". Repeat with second half of dough.
  
  Brush edges of casseroles with egg yolk and place crusts atop
  casseroles. Flute edges. Make 4 triangular cuts in center of each
  crust and fold back tips of triangles. Brush crust with egg yolk
  (save egg whites for another use). Bake at 400'F. until crust is
  golden brown and contents hot and bubbly, 20-30 minutes. Makes 4
  servings.

      Title: LOUISIANA CHICKEN STEW
 Categories: Stews
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Whole chicken breasts (about
           -3 pounds), skin on, cut
           -into 8 pieces (you may use
           -boned breasts)
     12    Chicken thighs (about 4 lb)
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Coarsely chopped onion
      2 c  Coarsely chopped celery
      2 md Green bell peppers, coarsely
           -chopped
      1 cn Tomatoes, coarsely chopped,
           -with juice (32 oz)
      4 T  Tomato paste
      1 t  Hot pepper sauce, to taste
      4 c  Chicken broth or stock
      1 T  Fresh lemon juice
      2 lg Bay leaves
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
      1 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/4 lb Precooked, coarsely chopped
           -andouille sausage or other
           -spicy garlic sausage
 
  NOTE: This tasty stew will reward you for the time it takes to make a
  proper roux, which add depth.
  
  Heat the oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven. Working in small batches
  over medium-high heat, brown the chicken pieces on all sides (skin
  side down first). With thongs, remove each browned batch to a platter.
  
  After all the chicken is browned, make a New Orleans-style roux; Pour
  the remaining oil form the Dutch oven into a measuring cup. Return
  1/4 cup to the Dutch oven and heat over medium heat. Add the flour
  and stir, scraping flour from the bottom of the pan as it slowly
  browns. Stir constantly until the roux is a rich brown, the color of
  a paper bag. (Be careful: When a roux begins to brown, it can burn
  very quickly and will continue to cook, even off the heat, until
  liquid is added.) This will take about 20 minutes.
  
  Immediately stir in the onions, celery and peppers. Cook until wilted,
  about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, lemon juice, hot
  pepper sauce, bay leaves, broth, garlic, salt and pepper. Bring to a
  simmer
  
  Remove the skin and visible fat from the chicken. Return to the pan.
  Simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Add the sausage. Skim off
  fat as it collects on top of the sauce. Cook another 30 minutes, or
  until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick.
  
  TO SERVE AFTER FREEZING: Thaw as recommended. Reheat slowly in a
  covered pot over medium-low heat. Serve in shallow soup dishes over
  freshly cooked white rice. Serves 12.

      Title: SUNDAY CHICKEN REVISITED
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Whole chicken breasts, skin
           -left on (weight after
           -boning, 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 lb)
      3 tb Butter, cut into 6 pieces
           -and slightly softened
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
    3/4 t  Cornstarch, mixed with
      1 tb Water
 
  NOTE: Because most boneless chicken breasts these days come without
  skin, ask your butcher to so it specially, or buy bone-in breasts and
  bone them yourself.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425'F. Rub the chicken breasts on all sides with
  butter; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fold each breast in half, skin
  side out, stretching the skin as much as possible to cover the meat.
  Hold the "bundle" together by running through with wooden or metal
  skewers.
  
  Bake on the rack of a roasting pan for 25-30 minutes, or until an oven
  thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers
  155-160'F. Remove to a cutting board. Loosely cover with aluminum
  foil to keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, add the broth to the roasting pan. Scrape the pan with a
  wooden spatula to dissolve the meat juices. Pour this liquid into a
  fat separator (or a regular measuring cup) and wait a bit for the fat
  to rise to the top. Pour off (or spoon off) the fat. Pour the
  defatted liquid into a small pan and bring to a rapid boil. Boil down
  to 3/4 cup of liquid. Stir in the dissolved cornstarch, and cook
  until the gravy thickens slightly.
  
  Discard the chicken skin, if you like. Cut each breast diagonally into
  about eight long, thin slices. Arrange on a platter and pass the gravy
  separately.
  
  Per 5 1/2 ounce serving, with 2 tablespoons gravy: 271 calories, 48
  grams protein, 0.7 grams carbohydrates, 0 grams fiber, 7 grams fat

      Title: CURRY IN A HURRY
 Categories: Indian, Curry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp or boneless, skinless
           -chicken breasts
  2 1/2 tb Oil
  1 1/2 t  Curry powder
    1/4 t  Red chili powder or
           -cayenne pepper
      1 t  Crushed garlic
      1 cn Crushed or whole skinless
           -tomatoes, chopped (1 lb)
      1 t  Crushed ginger (opt)
           Salt to taste
      1 tb Heavy cream (opt)
    1/4 c  Fresh chopped coriander
    1/2 t  Lemon juice
 
  If using shrimp, clean and devein. Saute them lightly on both sides
  until they become pinkish, then set aside. If using chicken, cut the
  meat into 1" strips and set aside. In a saucepan or wok, heat the oil
  and "splutter fry" the curry powder and red chili powder and then the
  garlic rapidly for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, then add the ginger,
  if desired, and salt; mix well and bring to a boil. Add the chicken
  or shrimp, and simmer until cooked (3-5 minutes for the shrimp, 6-10
  minutes for the chicken). Finally, do the "fimmering" process,
  simmering on high heat until the oil floats to the top for a minute
  or so. Remember that overcooking or overspicing can kill the curry.
  Use the optional cream to tame the curry or adjust the flavor.
  Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and a squeeze of lemon juice.
  Serves 2 as a main dish, 3-4 when served with other dishes.

  Place cream cheese, milk, garlic, onion flakes, and salt in bowl.
  Beat until fluffy.  Stir in chilies and cilantro leaves.  Brush both
  sides of a tortilla with water.  Spread one side of torilla with thin
  layer of the cream cheese mixture.  Cover torilla with a layer of the
  sliced meat.
  Roll up and place on plate, repeat.  Cover plate with plastic wrap and

      Title: PORTUGUESE ROAST TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1    (10-lb) fresh turkey
      2 lb Coarse (kosher) salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Garlic cloves
           - peeled and minced
      1 lb French or Italian bread
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  3 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 lg Egg yolks
 
  REMOVE THE GIBLETS from the turkey for another use. Fill the neck and body
  cavities of the turkey with coarse salt, then rub the skin well all over
  with salt. Place the turkey and remaining coarse salt in a large deep
  kettle, adding enough cold water to just cover the bird. Set in a cool spot
  for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  TO PREPARE THE STUFFING: Put the butter and olive oil in a large heavy
  saute pan, or better yet, a kettle, and place it over moderate heat. When
  the butter is melted, add the garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes until limp.
  Meanwhile, tear the bread into small chunks. Add the bread and the fine
  salt and pepper and toss well. Pour in the chicken stock and beat hard with
  a wooden spoon until the mixture is pastelike. Turn the heat to its lowest
  point, cover the kettle and steam 15-to-20 minutes until the bread absorbs
  all the liquid. Add the egg yolks to the stuffing mixture and beat hard
  until smooth. Remove from the heat and reserve. Preheat oven to 400F. Drain
  the turkey and rinse several times in cool water so that all traces of salt
  are gone. Place the bird on the counter with the neck cavity facing you.
  With your hands, begin working the skin free from the breast. Proceed
  gently, taking care not to tear the skin. It's slow going at first, but
  once you begin to free the skin, the job goes quickly. Loosen it all the
  way down the bird to within about 1 inch of the tail end, down both sides.
  With your hands, push the stuffing bit by bit far down under the skin and
  continue, packing it in lightly, until the breast is covered with about a
  1-inch layer. Next fill the neck cavity, skewer the neck skin flat against
  the back to enclose, and truss the bird. Place the turkey breast-side up in
  a large shallow roasting pan without a rack and roast uncovered for about 2
  1/2 hours. Do not baste. When the bird is richly browned and a leg moves
  easily in the hip joint, remove from the oven. Let stand, uncovered, 20
  minutes. Drain drippings into a sauce boat and keep warm. Remove trussing
  string and skewers and serve at once on a warmed platter.

  black peppers, paprika, salt and cumin, mixing well.  Place the turkey
  breast in a large glass bowl and sprinkle with 4 Tbsp of the mixture,
  coating well.  (store the remainder of the seasoning mix the a tight
  container for future use)
  
  Sprinkle the turkey with the liquid smoke, rubbing the seasoning mix and
  liquid over the entire breast.  Cover the bowl and marinate for two(2) days
  in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.
  
  Light the fire in a charcoal water smoker, cover, and let the heat and
  smoke accumulate.  When the smoker is ready, place the turkey breast on the
  wire rack and smoke for 7 hours.  Add water as needed.  Add a few mesquite
  chips every hour or so.  When the tasso is done, remove and set aside until
  cool enough to handle.  You will note it is very dry, almost like jerky.
  Don't worry, that's normal.  Store it in freezer bags up to one month in
  the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.
  
  note: This is not something you will really want to make a sandwich from.
  It is used primarily in gumbo, red beans, stuffings and some pasta dishes.
   It has a very pronounced flavor.  Basically, it can be used in place of
  smoked ham hocks or the like.  I like it by itself, but then I've been
  accused of having no taste buds left in my mouth because of the hot food I
  love to consume.

      1    Onion; thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Celery; diced
      2 c  Turkey; cooked,diced
           -(up to 3 cups)

SAUCE
      2 tb Turkey or chicken fat
           -(I would use butter)
      3 tb Flour
  2 1/2 c  -Water
    1/2 ts Savory
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Cream

--HOT BISCUITS--

      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Cream
      2    Eggs; beaten
 
  La fricasee fatuguee
  
  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat. Add
  thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low heat,
  stirring often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well before
  adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce is smooth
  and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or chicken gravy.
  Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with hot biscuits and
  pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour and
  mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should remain
  lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a greased cookie
  sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.
  
  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the turkey
  was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in the oven
  until browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted homemade bread.
  So, when it came time to make hash from all the little bits and pieces, the
  children felt that the poor turkey must be tired (fatiguee), hence the
  name.

      2    Stalks Celery (including
      1 sm Yellow Onion
           -some of the leaves)
    1/2    Zuchini
      5 md Or 6 md Mushrooms

----BOWL TWO----
      3 md Carrots - grated

---BOWL THREE---
      5    To 6 Roma Tomatoes,
           -Juice & center of
           -cut up with seeds and juice
           -baking tomatoes

--CUT UP IN SMALL PIECES--
      1 cn Whole tomatoes (bowl 3)

---BOWL FOUR---
      1 c  Cooked meat, flaked into
           -bite size chunks. Poultry -
           -chicken or turkey is
           -recommended, but experiment

--HAVE READY TO PREPARE--
      5 lg To 6 Garlic cloves, cleaned
           Ginger root (fresh)
      4 lg To 5 lg Bell Peppers,*
      3 lg To 4 lg Tomatoes,**
 
  * Green or Red, cored and rinsed of seeds ** cored and the insides spooned
  out into bowl 3. PREPARATION: In a large frying pan, heat pan and add olive
  oil. Press 2 cloves of garlic into oil, and stir. When it begins to cook,
  add Bowl #2 (carrots). Stir carefully, and when it stops spitting, add Bowl
  #1. Add soy to taste to mixture and toss. Let cook until onions start to
  clarify, stirring frequently. Add the fresh tomato bowl (Bowl #3) and stir
  until tomatoes are tender. Add the cooked tomatoes and juice, and stir in
  well. While cooking, grate the ginger, add the remaining garlic (crushed).
  When mixture begins to dry, add the spaghetti sauce, a dash of nutmeg, a
  dash of five spice powder, pepper, and the taco sauce mixture. Stir in the
  powder well. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes on simmer, and taste. Add
  crushed red peppers to desired taste, but sauce should be hot. I used about
  a 1/2 tsp. Add enough water to make it mix well, and add the meat (Bowl
  #4). Reduce until semi-thick while stirring (or it will stick) Let it cool
  for a few moments. Mix equal amounts of rice and sauce in a bowl, about 3
  Tbsp for each item to be stuffed. Stuff the tomatoes and peppers carefully,
  trying to fill all gaps. Arrange on pan that fits them, and bake at 350
  degrees for about a half hour. Be careful to fill them completely, but not
  overfill, the idea being that they should not leak any of the sauce. When
  done, the skins will be wrinkled and lighter in color, but still have some
  crunch. Serve with extra unused sauce as a toping. The baked sauce will be
  far less spicy than the origional sauce. Sauce can also be served over
  rice.

  slowly, a little at a time, while tossing mixture to moisten thoroughly.
  Take care to add only enough liquid to moisten or stuffing will become
  sodden. To test stuffing in order to see if seasonings are correct, melt a
  little butter in small skillet. Add rounded tablespoon of stuffing to
  skillet and stir until lightly golden. If it needs a more lively flavor,
  add more sage, onions or celery. Makes Enough for 16-Pound Turkey

      2    Eggs;slightly beaten
           Matza meal*
      3    Egg yolks
 
  *Matzots and mastza meal may be bought in Jewish grocery stores and many
  supermarkets *The recipe calls for cubes of turkey breast to be ground;
  however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be acceptable
  
  Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them. In a
  large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute, stirring frequently
  until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried sage is used, enclose it
  in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you using ground turkey, add garlic
  and bay leaf to this cheesecloth bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool.
  Remove and discard bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to
  saucepan with oil and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid from
  the matzot, but do not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the saucepan and
  turn heat off. If using cubed turkey breast, grind it now and return to the
  saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly. Oil a 9 inch cake pan and
  sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture into it; level it with a
  spatula. With a small ladle, make three depressions near the centre and
  place 1 egg yolk in each depression. Bake in 375F oven for 1/2 hour.

      6 oz Mushrooms, sliced
  1 1/2 lb Bread crumbs
  1 1/2 ts Sage
  1 1/2 ts Marjoram
  1 1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Stock
            Gravey For "Turkey"
      2 ts Margarine
  2 1/2 tb Flour
      1 c  Reserved gluten stock
           -from "turkey" recipe
      1 tb White wine
           Several dashes soy sauce
      1 tb Light Yeast Flovoring
           -see recipe, optional
 
  The yuba must be soaked and reconstituted to a soft, pliable texture before
  using.  It is best to put individual sheets between wet towels until they
  turn soft and white in color.  They are then ready to use. Using either
  wheat flour or vital wheat gluten flour, make gluten according to the
  recipe.  Roll it out into a rectangle approximately 15 inches long and 8 to
  10 inches wide.  Sprinkle with 1/3 cup yeast flavoring (unless you've added
  it in with your vital wheat gluten).  Roll it up lengthwise. Spread out the
  cheesecloth and place the glutten roll in the middle. Wrap the sides of the
  cloth around the glutten roll first, then tie the ends together. It should
  be wrapped fairly loosely so that the gluten can expand a little while
  cooking but not so loose that it expands too much and becomes too soft and
  spongy in texture. Place the roll in a large pot. Pour over it the gallon
  of water and the remaining 2/3 cup yeast flavoring. Cover bring to a boil,
  turn down the heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. This process can be done up
  to two days before serving. Prepare the stuffing of your choice. Remove the
  gluten roll from the stock, saving the stock for gravy. Untie and remove
  the cheesecloth. Unroll the "turkey" and fill it with the stuffing, or
  mound the stuffing on a large greased baking sheet and place the gluten
  around it.  Place the stuffed gluten on a large greased baking sheet.
  Reconstitute the yuba as mentioned before, by soaking for 5 minutes in
  water in a flat, shallow dish or between layors of wet towels.  It will
  turn white and be pliable but will still be fragile.  Cover the "turkey"
  with two to three layers of yuba.  Melt the margarine and brush the entire
  "turkey" with some of it.  Pour the wine into the remaining margarine: this
  will be used for basting while baking.  If desired, 2 tablespoons of the
  yeast flavoring can be added to the margarine-wine mixture to give it an
  even more authentic flavor.

           Water, cold
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  Turkey drippings
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Assuming you are going to roast a turkey in the oven, it will be
  in a roasting pan of some kind.  I am also assuming this turkey
  had giblets (you know, liver, heart, gizzard and neck). While
  the turkey is roasting, put the giblets in a pretty large pot
  with lots of water and a little salt.  Bring them to a boil and
  let 'em simmer.  No length of time - just till they are done.
  
  After you remove the turkey from the roaster, there should be
  lots of juices in there that have accumulated during roasting.
   I pour them out into something and skim the fat off (or use one
  of those fat skimming cups or brushes).  Then, put the de-fatted
  drippings back into the pan.  Add some of the liquid from
  cooking the giblets if needed to make 2 c.  Whisk
  flour into it, and simmer while it thickens.
  
  Scrape up all of the "goodies" from the bottom of the pan to
  make the gravy extra-flavorful. If it gets too thick, you can
  add more liquid. If it isn't thick enough, add more flour and
  continue to whisk it, to keep out most of the lumps. You can
  chop up the giblets, finely and add them to the gravy as it is
  almost done - just to heat them through.
  
  If you have to add something because the color is not what you
  would like, a dash of Kitchen Bouquet will do it - not much.

      Title: LATTICE-TOPPED TURKEY PIE
 Categories: Poultry, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Turkey; cooked, chopped
     10 oz Peas
      4 oz Cheese, cheddar, shredded
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Onions, chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper, black
      1 c  Mayonnaise
      1 cn Crescent dinner rolls
      2 ts Seeds, sesame
 
  Preheat oven to 350.  Combine first 8 ingredients; mix well. Spoon into a
  12"x8"x2" baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick coating. Separate
  crescent dough into rectangles; press perforations to seal. Cut into 4 long
  strips and 4 short strips. Arrange strips in lattice design across top of
  your casserole. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake 35 minutes. Garnish with
  radish slices and fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.
  
  Sylvia's comments: This was a big hit at our house -- only a little strip
  was left along one edge of the casserole! I used nonfat mayonnaise, and bet
  that nonfat yogurt would work just as well to cut down on fat. I was out of
  peas, so used corn.  And I used leftover chicken instead of turkey. Save
  this one for a neat way to use up your leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/4 lb Butter
      1    Turkey,fresh (12-16#)
    1/2 lb Salt pork,thinly sliced

      3 c  Water
    1/2    Onion,small,sliced
    1/2    Garlic clove
    1/2    Bay leaf
    1/8 ts Basil,crumbled
    1/8 ts Rosemary,crumbled
    1/8 ts Thyme,crumbled
    1/8 ts Salt

---TURKEY GIBLET GRAVY---
    1/4 c  Pan drippings
    1/4 c  Flour
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Turkey stock
           Turkey giblets,cooked,choped
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  1. Preheat oven to 425'F.~ 2. Cut butter into very thin slices; place in
  freezer to harden while you prepare bird.~ 3. Wash turkey inside and out.
  Remove and reserve neck, giblets and wing tips. Pat dry with paper
  toweling. Starting at the breast, separate the skin from the meat by
  working your fingers between them. Slice your hand under skin as far as you
  can go and gently free the skin on both sides of the breast. Loosen it
  around the upper part of the legs, stopping about halfway down the legs.
  Insert slices of the cold butter, first under the leg skin, then under the
  breast skin. Reshape the loosened skin on the bird by patting it gently
  back in place. It will sag a bit but don't let that upset you; it will cook
  back in place. Wrap bird loosely in waxed paper and refrigerate while
  preparing stuffing.~ 4. Fill cavity of turkey loosely with stuffing. (Place
  any remaining stuffing in a shallow baking dish and place in oven about 30
  minutes before bird is roasted. Bake until firm and lightly browned.)
  Fasten neck skin of turkey to body with skewer. Push legs under band of
  skin at tail or tie to tail. Place slices of salt pork over breast and
  fasten with wooden picks. Place turkey on its side on rack in shallow open
  roasting pan.~ 5. Cook for 15 minutes, then turn bird on other side and
  roast for 15 minutes longer.~ 6. Lower temperature to 325'F. and continue
  to roast turkey, turning the bird from side to side and basting often with
  the drippings from pan, for about 3-1/2 to 4 hours, or until juices run
  yellow - no longer pink - when thigh is pierced with a fork. Roast turkey
  breast side up for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. (Remove and discard
  salt pork when crisp and most of fat has been rendered. If fat in pan bgins
  to burn, add a few tablespoons of water.) Transfer turkey to serving
  platter and let rest 30 minutes before carving. Reserve all drippings in
  pan for gravy.~ ~ *** CORN BREAD STUFFING ***~ 1. Prepare corn bread,
  following label directions, or use your own favorite recipe. Cool. Crumble
  enough to make 7 cups and transfer to a large mixing bowl.~ 2. Saute celery
  and onion in butter in a large skillet until soft. Spoon vegetables and
  butter over corn bread crumbs.~ 3. Beat egg yolks in a medium-sized bowl;
  stir in stock and pour mixture over corn bread. Stir lightly to blend.
  Season with salt and pepper to taste.~ Makes approximately 3 quarts, or 12
  cups.~ ~ *** TURKEY STOCK ***~ 1. Combine giblets, neck, and wing tips with
  water in a large saucepan; add remaining ingredients. Bring to boil, then
  lower heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until liver is tender.
  Remove liver and continue to simmer mixture for about 1 hour, or until
  remaining giblets are tender. Strain mixture; remove and chop giblets and
  liver for gravy. Reserve stock.~ ~ *** TURKEY GIBLET GRAVY ***~ 1. Pour off
  all turkey fat from roasting pan into a glass measuring cup. Measure and
  return 1/4 cup to pan. Sprinkle flour into fat; cook and stir 2 or 3
  minutes over low heat. Add water and 2 cups of the reserved turkey stock.
  Cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits in pan with wooden spoon, until
  gravy thickens and bubbles 2 minutes. Strain gravy into saucepan; add
  chopped giblets and reserved liver. Taste; season with salt and pepper if
  needed.
 

 

 
      Title: 400-CLOVE GARLIC TURKEY FROM THE STINKING ROSE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Turkey
      4 oz Butter
      2 oz Olive oil
      1 c  Sage, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed
           Salt
           Pepper
      2 lb Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 c  Wine, white
      2 c  Stock, chicken
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Turkey stock may be substituted for chicken stock, if available.
  
  Clean and wash the turkey and pat dry with a paper towel. Loosen the skin
  of the breast and rub the turkey under the skin with the sage and chopped
  garlic. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and pepper and remaining
  sage. Place turkey in a large roasting pan, preferably on a rack. Roast the
  turkey at 350 degrees, basting every twenty minutes with the melted butter
  and olive oil combined.
  
  An hour and half before the turkey will be finished, add the 400 garlic
  cloves to the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to baste the turkey and
  at the same time stir the cloves at the bottom of the pan. Then the turkey
  is done, remove it from the pan. Drain the drippings into a small sauce
  pan, reserving the garlic in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on a
  burner over medium-high heat. Add white wine and stock. Bring to a boil,
  stirring with a wisk to mash the roasted garlic cloves.
  
  Place the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat and with a whip add
  the flour to form a roux. Add the roux to the garlic gravy a little at a
  time until it reaches the desired thickness. Carve the turkey and serve
  with the 400-clove garlic gravy, accompnied by garlic mashed potatoes.
  
  This popular North Beach restaurant claims that it "seasons its garlic with
  food."  You'll see what they mean when you look at the list of ingredients.

      Title: STUFFING BALLS
 Categories: Dressings, Holiday
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      1 x  Turkey giblets
      8 tb Butter
      4    Celery tops
     20 sl Bread
     20 sl Bread, salt rising
     16 oz Pepperidge Farm stuffing
      2 c  Chicken stock
      2    Onions, chopped
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  Boil giblets, butter, and celery tops until done. Toast breads, then break
  toast into small pieces.  Add Pepperidge Farm stuffing to toast. Cook
  chopped onions in stock. When tender, add to bread mix. If dressing is too
  dry, add chicken stock for additional moisture. Preheat oven to 350. Form
  into serving-size balls and place in buttered baking dish. Spoon additional
  broth over balls. Bake 1 hour or until brown.
  
  This dressing is moist and is very easy to serve.  If I have too much for
  Thanksgiving I freeze uncooked balls and use them at Christmas which helps
  speed up dinner that busy day. I hope that your kids will like this recipe;
  mine always liked the balls.
  
  The one secret to my dressing is Salt Rising bread. My Grandmother always
  used it with other bread (we had to keep it a secret because my father
  hated salt rising even though you can not tell is is in there). I also have
  a hard time making just a little dressing and it always looks like I'm
  fixing for an army.

    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato; Peeled & Seeded,1 Md

  powder, and chicken bouillon granules.  Blend until very smooth. Transfer
  to a small saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 7
  minutes.  Stir in the chicken or turkey.  Season with a little salt and
  pepper.  Keep warm.  With a fork, beat the eggs with the second 1/4 cup of
  water, the salt and pepper, until well blended but not frothy. In an 8-inch
  omelet pan heat 1 Tbls of the butter until it sizzles and browns slightly.
  Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides. Pour about 1/2 cup of the egg
  mixture, leaving the heat on medium-high. As the egg sets, lift the edges
  to allow the uncooked portion on top to run under the cooked portion.
  Continue until all of the egg is cooked.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the
  chicken mixture down the center of the omelet.  Fold the sides of the
  omelet up over the chicken mixture.  Tilt the omelet pan to roll the omelet
  over and out onto a hot plate.  Repeat with the remaining butter, egg
  mixture and chicken filling, three more times and serve hot.

  pepper, and salt on one half of turkey breast, and place other half
  on top.  Put in a medium-size loaf pan, tucking reserved skin around
  the breast to seal in juices.  Bake for approximately 2-1/3 hours
  (the rule of thumb is 35 minutes per pound).  Poke the turkey with a
  fork.  When the juices run clear, turkey is done.

      Title: TURKEY AND ROCKET SALAD WITH MACADAMIAS
 Categories: Salads, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Bunch of rocket, discarding
           The coarse stem ends
      1 sm Soft lettuce
    250 g  Macadamia nuts
      2 cl Garlic, chopped
           Salt & pepper to taste
    100 ml Macadamia oil
     50 ml White wine vinegar
      1 lb Turkey, sliced
           Chives
 
      Turkey meat, which tends to be dry, benefits particularly from this
  macadamia dressing, but any roast poultry meat you have left over can be
  used instead. Another soft lettuce can stand in for the rocket (arugula) if
  you simply can't obtain the latter, but it won't provide the delicate,
  savoury flavour. Macadamia oil can now be obtained in some supermarkets.
      Arrange the leaves on four plates.
  
      Heat 250 g macadamia nuts in an ungreased container in the oven until
  they smell appetizing, then set half aside and tip the other half into the
  bowl of a food processor. Add: 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped. With salt
  and pepper process to a paste.
   With the food processor.running, slowly add 100 ml macadamia oil, then 50
  ml white wine vinegar.
  
      Slice or shred enough turkey for four people and gently loss it in the
  macadamia salad.
  
      Arrange the dressed turkey on the prepared plates, drizzle left-over
  dressing over the salad leaves, Sprinkle with reserved macadamia nuts,
  roughly chopped, and finely chopped chives. Serve.

     A few extra chillies would give this salad a lot more punch.

           The scraps left after
           Carving*
           Any left over gravy
           Any left over vegetables
      2 lg Carrots, sliced
      2    Stalks celery (& tops),
           Chopped
      1 cn (12 oz) no salt green
           Beans, drained
      2 qt Boiling water
           Any peels, root ends and
           Leafy tops left over from -
           Onions, celery, potatoes,
           Carrots
           Several bruised garlic
           Cloves
     12 oz Wide egg noodles

           Drained
      1 lg White onion, chopped
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
    Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a
  chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over peelings &
  parings into a stock pot and fill with water.  Add garlic cloves.  Fill the
  stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let
  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
  large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
  and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
  turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
  left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
  the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
  over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
  per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
  the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
  Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
  heat noodles and serve.
  
  Makes a bunch!
 

 

 
      Title: CHILI WITH BEANS

      4 lb Lean beef sirloin, chopped
           In 1/2 inch cubes
      1 lb Low-fat turkey sausage

      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Red cayenne pepper

      1 ts Louisiana (or Tobasco) Hot
           Sauce
      1 cn Jalapenos, chopped
    1/2 tb Salt
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Michael Gallagher Bob, here is my variation of
  a chili recipe with beans in it. If the people here don't like beans with
  their chili, I'll give a substitution. DON'T change anything, for this is
  the way you should make authentic Texas chili--not the cheap imitation
  stuff.
  
  Wash beans in colander and soak overnight. Wash again next day, and place
  in large chili pot. Cover with water about 1/2 to 3/4 inch over beans;
  simmer, covered, for about 2-1/2 hours or until done.
  
  If substituting beans with the lean beef sirloin, brown the meat 1 pound at
  a time, preferably in a non-stick skillet without any oil. Place the meat
  in large chili pot. You will also need 1 more 12 ounce can of tomato sauce
  and 1 to 2 10 ounce cans of fat-skimmed beef stock. You will add the extra
  can of tomato sauce and the can of beef stock in the next paragraph of
  directions.
  
  Brown meat and place in large saucepan. Add all of the other ingredients
  and spices. Mix well. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour. When beans are done, add
  contents of saucepan to chili pot and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Makes 15
  to 20 servings, 225 calories each (205 with out the oil). Salt and pepper
  to taste.

    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
    1/4 c  Minced parsley (optional)
    1/4 ts Ground thyme

      1 c  Grated cheddar cheese, med.
    1/4 c  Dry white wine - or gravy
           Salt and pepper to taste

SAUCE
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Flour
      3 c  Chicken broth - I use
           - homemade gravy instead
      1 c  Milk
      2 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
    1/4 ts Tobasco
           Salt and pepper to taste

  Fill Stuff-a-roni.
  
  Cover bottom of 2 quart baking dish with 1 cup cheese sauce.  Arrange
  filled stuff-a-roni in single layer in baking dish.  Cover with remaining
  sauce.
  
  Cover dish with foil and bake at 375-degrees F., for one hour; or cover
  dish with waxed paper and microwave 30 minutes turning once.
  
  Note: I usually make this dish after Thanksgiving.  I freeze left over
  turkey and gravy, and then later, when turkey seems like a treat again, I
  make the Stuff-a-roni.  I do not use the wine; in it's place I use turkey
  gravy, and when it calls for broth, I also use a fair portion of turkey
  gravy.

      1    Large Oven Roasting Bag
           - (turkey size)
      1    Recipe Turkey Basting Agent
           (see index)
 
  TURKEY COOKED IN THE MICROWAVE REMAINS TASTY LONGER THEN OVEN
  
  First stuff the turkey with your favorite stuffing mix. Then paint the
  turkey with the prepared turkey basting agent (see index). Gently place the
  stuffed and painted bird in the flour dusted roasting bag and place into a
  glass microwave roasting pan.  Enter the weight of the turkey on your
  microwave computer.  For example, a 12 lb, 8 oz bird will cook in the
  microwave oven 115-121 minutes at 70% power. Standing time will be 57-60
  minutes. Dividing the time into fourths, the bird will cook at 70% power
  for about 29 minutes on its breast side; turn the dish and cook another 29
  minutes.  Now carefully turn the bird upside down (there will be a lot of
  juices in the bag, so be extra careful). With the bird breast side up, cook
  another 29 minutes at 70% power.

      Title: ROMAN PIE
 Categories: Meats, Pasta
      Yield: 8 servings
 
---FOR THE MEAT LAYERS---
      1 lb Cooked turkey or chicken *
    1/4 lb Cooked ham
    1/4 lb Cooked tongue
     50 g  Canned anchovy fillets
    3/4 lb Mushrooms
      1 lg Bunch parsley
           Lemon juice
           A few black olives
           Canned consomme **

---FOR THE PASTA LAYERS---
      6 oz Macaroni
 12 1/2 fl Milk
    1/2 pt Single cream
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain flour
      4 oz Cheddar cheese
      1 oz Parmesan cheese
 
  *Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
  pheasant and other birds can be used instead.
  
  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream.  Let it
  simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
  Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
  go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
  this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
  salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
  cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
  fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
  and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
  pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
  the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
  as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
  tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
  each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
  adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
  decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients.  Press down
  lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
  cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
  refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
  be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
  serving.

           -chocolate
           Sea salt to taste
 
  Oaxacan Black Mole Serves 10 to 12
  
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste.  Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and
  continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35 minutes.
  Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and remove
  seeds and veins, reserving the seeds.  Toast the chilies for about 50
  seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them longer, until
  they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the chilies in cold water,
  cover with hot water, and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Put the
  reserved chile seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast over fairly
  high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that they brown evenly.
  Then raise the heat and char until black.  Cover with cold water and set
  aside to soak for about 5 minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed until a
  deep golden color - a few seconds.  Strain, putting the fat back into the
  pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate, one by
  one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each addition and
  adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to cook
  the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat, stirring and
  scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in which
  they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth. When you
  have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried ingredients together
  with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes longer. Add about 4 cups of the
  chicken broth and continue cooking for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms
  on the top if you are going to make tamales or mole. It is added to color
  and flavor the masa.)  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just
  coat the back of a wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste;
  cook for 10 minutes longer.

      Title: MOLE POBLANO PICANTE
 Categories: Poultry, Soups/stews, Mexican, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8    Mulato chiles
      4    Ancho chiles
      4    Pasilla chiles
      8 lb Turkey, in pieces
      4 tb Lard
      4 tb Sesame seeds
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      1    Tortilla, cut up
      1 c  Blanched almonds
    1/8 ts Ground gloves
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seed
    1/4 ts Anise
    1/2 c  Raisins
      3    Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      4    Canned chipotle chiles
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Prepare the mulato, ancho, and pasilla chiles by washing in cold water;
  removing veins, stems, and seeds; and tearing them roughly into pieces.
  Place the pieces in a bowl and soak in hot water (about 1 cup to 6 chiles)
  for about an hour. Blend the chiles with the soaking water in a blender,
  but do not over blend. The texture should remain coarse.
  
  Place the turkey pieces in a flameproof casserole with a lid, and poach,
  covered, in salted water to barely cover for 1 hour. Drain, reserving the
  stock. Dry the turkey pieces thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the lard in
  a skillet, and brown the turkey pieces, a few at a time. Arrange the turkey
  pieces in the casserole and keep warm. Combine 2 tbs of the sesame seeds,
  the onion, garlic, tortilla, almonds, cloves, cinnamon, coriander seed,
  anise, raisins, tomatoes, prepared chiles, and chipotle chiles, and reduce,
  bit by bit, to a coarse puree in the electric blender.
  
  Heat the remaining lard in a skillet, adding, if necessary, a little more
  lard to bring it up to 3 TBS. Cook the puree, stirring constantly, for
  about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the turkey stock, chocolate, salt and pepper
  to taste, and the sugar, and cook, over very low heat, until the chocolate
  has melted. Pour the sauce over the turkey; cover; and cook over the lowest
  possible heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The sauce should be rather
  thicker than the consistency of heavy cream. If it seems too thin, thin
  with turkey stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before
  serving.
  
  NOTE: Chipotle chile and its close relative morita chile have the most
  exotic flavor of any of the Mexican chiles. They are also exceedingly
  picante and can really lift your head off. If you do not care for hot food,
  experiment with the chipotle, for even in a small quantity its flavor will
  survive. Begin with a half chile, tasting and adding more to your mole with
  caution until you find the amount that suits your taste.

      4 tb Sesame seeds
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Anise
      1 lb Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
  Picante. Place the turkey and pork in a large kettle with enough salted
  water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Drain,
  reserving the stock. Dry the turkey and pork pieces thoroughly with paper
  towels. Heat the lard in a large, heavy skillet. Brown the turkey and pork
  pieces, a few at a time; then transfer to a flameproof casserole. In the
  electric blender, blend the almonds, peanuts, tortilla, 2 tbs of the sesame
  seeds, cloves, cinnamon, anise, tomatoes, and the prepared chiles, and
  reduce to a coarse puree.
  
  Heat the lard remaining in the skillet, adding a little more if necessary,
  and cook the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 2 cups of the
  reserved stock, the chocolate, salt and pepper to taste, and sugar. Stir
  until chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce over the turkey and pork in the
  casserole; cover; and cook over very low heat for about 1 hour, taking care
  not to let it burn. Sauce should be the consistency of heavy cream, so, if
  necessary, thin with more stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just
  before serving.

 Categories: Mexican, Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
           Jim Vorheis
      2 lg Chickens (about 3 1/2 lbs
           -each), cut into
           Serving pieces, or 1 7-pound
           -turkey
      2 sm Heads of garlic, scored
           -around the middle
      2 sm White onions, roughly sliced
      6    Fresh mint sprigs
           Sea salt to taste
           The sauce:
    1/4 lb Chilhuacles negros or
           -guajillos
      2 oz Chilies pasillas (Mexican,
           -not Oaxacan)
      2 oz Chilies mulatos
    1/2 lb (about 1 large) tomatoes,
           -broiled
      1 c  Water
      3    Whole cloves
      3    Whole allspice
      6    Fresh thyme sprigs, leaves
           -only, or 1/4 tsp dried
      2 tb Oaxacan or 1 Tbsp Mexican
           -oregano
    3/4 c  Melted lard or safflower oil
    1/4 c  Sesame seed
    1/4 c  Shelled peanuts
     10    Unskinned almonds
    1/4 c  Raisins
      1 sm Onion, thickly sliced
      1    Ripe plantain, skinned and
           -cut into thick slices
      2    Crisp-fried corn tortillas
      3    Thick slices dried French
           -bread or semisweet roll
      2 oz Tablet Mexican drinking
           -chocolate
           Sea salt to taste
 
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste.  Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and
  continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35 minutes.
  Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and remove
  seeds and veins, reserving the seeds.  Toast the chilies for about 50
  seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them longer, until
  they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the chilies in cold water,
  cover with hot water, and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Put the
  reserved chile seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast over fairly
  high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that they brown evenly.
  Then raise the heat and char until black.  Cover with cold water and set
  aside to soak for about 5 minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed until a
  deep golden color - a few seconds.  Strain, putting the fat back into the
  pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate, one by
  one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each addition and
  adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to cook
  the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat, stirring and
  scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in which
  they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth. When you
  have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried ingredients together
  with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes longer. Add about 4 cups of the
  chicken broth and continue cooking for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms
  on the top if you are going to make tamales or mole. It is added to color
  and flavor the masa.)  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just
  coat the back of a wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste;
  cook for 10 minutes longer.

      Title: CHEESE FONDUE, AMERICAN STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings

      4 cn Campbell's Cheddar cheese
           Soup, undiluted
      1 lb Cheddar cheese sharp, grated
      5 x  Cloves fresh garlic
           Or 1tbsp. garlic powder
      2 tb Kirsch or cherry brandy
           ****DIPPERS****
           FRENCH BREAD
           Ham
           Shrimp
           Smokie links
           Cocktail wieners
           ****DIPPERS****
           Hot dogs
           Smoked sausage
           Turkey, chicken breast
           Turkey ham
           Broccoli
           Cauliflower
           Carrots
           Mushrooms
           Brussel sprouts
           Cherry tomatoes
           Celery stalk
           Radishes
 
  Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
  grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
  freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
  small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
  while stirring.
  FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your area, if not,
  any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at 350 degrees
  for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces. It's best
  when crusty.
  MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized pieces any or all of
  these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail wieners, smoked sausage,
  turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham, hot dogs.
  VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or else the
  pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the pot.... or
  raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,
  mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk, radishes.
  VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's Nacho cheese
  dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for regular
  cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalapeo peppers to
  the cheese mixture for extra zest.
  SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall
  day for lunch, or a freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts
  during a gentle spring rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne
  or wine. Best mood is created if candles are lit and a fire is
  blazing in the fireplace.
  Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
  heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
  fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
  sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
  so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
  years). Enjoy!

      Title: ALHEIRAS DE MIRANDELA
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 15 units
 
      3 lb Lean beef*
  1 1/2 lb Calf meat
    1/2 lb Chicken
    1/2 lb Turkey
    1/2 lb Rabbit
  1 1/2 lb Day old wheat bread
    1/4 lb Ham (optional)
      4    Garlic cloves
      4 ts Olive oil
      2 oz Pork drippings**
           Paprika, salt and
           -piripiri to taste
     10    Feet tripe casing
 
  *    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons.
  **   Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet.
  You may change the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be
  all chicken, etc., provided the total amount remains the same.
  You can use partridge, quail, duck, and so on...
  Boil the meats together long enough to make the bones separate from
  the meat by themselves. Reserve the resulting broth and set meats
  aside.
  In a large bowl place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth.
  Cover with a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with
  an wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and a
  little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix thoroughly.
  When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and the pork
  drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie each
  'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling concentrated in
  the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty. Smoke for 2 or 3
  hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together before selling or using
  ~ the 'alheira' should be U shaped.
  A typical way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil,
  and presenting them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add
  broccoli as a side dish.

  mashed tofu to the cloth covered colander, press down and cover with the
  overlapping sides.  Place the whole thing in a large bowl. Cover the
  cheesecloth with a plate that fits inside the colander and place a 5 pound
  weight on the plate. Refrigerate and let sit for 2 to 3 hours.
  
  When time is up, start the stuffing.  Saute' the onions, celery and
  mushrooms in the 2 tablesoons sesame oil.  When soft, add the garlic and

  the "turkey" with foil, and bake at 400 degrees for about 1 hour.
  
  Remove foil, baste with all the remaining mixture except a few tablespoons
  and return to oven for 1 hour more, or until the "turkey" is golden. Remove
  from oven and use rest of basting mix.  Using at least 2 large spatulars,
  move to a large plate.  Serve with the gravy of your choice, if you wish,
  and cranberry sauce. Tastes good leftover (if there is any!) in sandwiches
  or plain.

      Title: PORRO'S ONE POT OLYMPIC POULTRY
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Easy
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Ingredients:
           Chicken or Turkey parts to
           -match servings desired.
      1 qt Chicken Broth or Chicken
           -Soup
      1 ts Cilantro
      1 ts Ground Correander Seed (only
           -if you don't use Cilantro!)
      1 tb Oregano
    1/4 sm Onion chopped
      1    Clove garlic minced
    1/4 c  Cooking wine (bitter orange
           -or other fruit is best)
      1 ts Ground White pepper
      1 tb Crushed Red pepper (subst.
           -Cayenne)
      1 ts Sweet Basil (optional, I
           -like it)
    1/4    Lemon with rind on
      1 c  Rice uncooked (I don't use
           -pre-cooked type, but either
           -works)
 
  Choose your large cast iron pot (my usual) or in my case now with no
  stove, a West Bend electric fry pan.
  
  Set to simmer and add chicken soup. (I use egg drop by the way, but
  that's another step) While broth is warming, wash chicken as you
  usually do. Add all seasonings except the peppers. Squeeze the lemon
  for it's juice and toss it in without the seeds. When you can see
  that the broth is just starting to boil every time the light goes
  out, you know it's just right, below boiling temp. You don't want
  this to boil unless you are in a hurry, want to do lots of pot
  watching or you like tough chicken. No need to add salt or sugar
  since there is usually more than enough already in the soup. The
  chicken should not be covered in liquid, this is not intended to be
  soup when you get done.
  
  When you have the temp. fine tuned to true simmer, place the poultry
  parts in the broth, meaty side up as possible. Sprinkle on the white
  and red pepper, cover the pot and ignore it for as long as you wish
  the longer the better, I usually shoot for at least 4 hours. Before
  serving at least 20 min. before you want to eat, flip the meat and
  add the rice. Check to make sure there is enough water, bring up to
  original level if necessary. This should turn out fairly thick, and
  not soup because the rice absorbs most or all of the liquid. Stir it
  in well and cover again. When the rice is done it's finished. Spoon
  out rice onto plates and place poultry on the side of it. I like to
  serve this with a large tossed salad, using Olive Oil, 1 T lemon
  juice, 2T Oregano, and 1 clove garlic, or garlic powder. (See Porro's
  Italian Salad for details)
  
  I use Cajun seasoning, but wanted this to have a more general appeal,
  if you like it hotter, go for it. Sort of a Cajun/Italian recipe.
  Some other notes and options. 2 t of parsley won't hurt. Also
  optional: (it's not cast in stone, add what you like) fresh sliced
  mushrooms. I confess, I never measure any of the above, it's all done
  by taste, do the same please! Anytime you use fresh spices it will
  taste better.
  
  Why I make and eat this. 1) For sporting events, one never knows for
  certain when it will be time to eat. Also if you have company that
  shows up late on a regular basis, this type of cooking and be on hold
  for extended periods of time, without harm. 2) No stove. 3) The slow
  cooking will make even a laying hen edible. 4) For a whomped up one
  pot, one plate dinner it actually has some taste to it.  5) Sometimes
  I want something that is easy and doesn't need tending, this is it.
  Probably best for family cooking rather than guests. 6) When I was
  cooking for three teens I never knew if any two would every be at
  home for dinner at the same time. It keeps well for hours after
  adding the rice.

           -(optional)
      2 tb Butter
      2    Onions chopped
      8 ct Pods, punctured
      3    2-inch cinnamon sticks
     10    To 15 peppercorns
      8    Cloves
  3 1/2 qt Water
      1 c  Chick-peas soaked
      4    Strips orange rind
    1/2 ts Saffron
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Nutmeg
      2 tb Honey
      1 cc Fresh ginger, sliced
      6    Sprigs parsley

           -chunks
      2    Sweet red peppers, seeded,
           -quartered
           Chopped cilantro for garnish
 
  If using the dried chiles, soak them in a cup of hot water for 1
  hour, then drain.  Pound or mince the chiles, garlic and salt into a
  paste. Mix all or some of this paste, according to the degree of
  hotness desired, with the broth, and serve hot, garnished with the
  cilantro.
  
  Aromatic Broth:
  
  Put the chicken parts, turkey neck and giblets, butter, onions,
  cardamom, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and cloves into a heavy pan.
  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Before the mixture begins to brown, add the remaining ingredients
  (except chopped cilantro).  Cover and simmer for 1 hour, skimming off
  as much fat as possible.  Raise the heat to medium and let the broth
  cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.  The broth should reduce to about 7 cups
  during this time. Season with salt and remove from heat.
  
  Remove the pieces of chicken and discard.  Strain the broth through a
  large sieve set over a large bowl, pressing against the vegetables.
  Set aside 3 cups broth to make the harissa sauce.  Serve the
  remainder, piping hot, garnished with cilantro.

      1    Smoked turkey, carcus
           -including any skin
     10 c  Water (approximately)
      1    Onion, sliced
      1    Stalk celery, sliced
      3    Sprigs parsley
      1    Sprig fresh thyme, or 1/4
           -teaspoon dried thyme
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Finely diced onion
    1/2 c  Finely diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced green or red
           -bell pepper
      1 ts Chile powder (New Mexico,
           -California or ancho)
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
    1/4 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
    1/8 ts Cayenne (optional)
      2 lb Assorted, shellfish *
      2 c  Cooked long-grain rice
 
  * small raw shrimp, peeled and deveined; cooked crab meat; small
  shucked oysters
  
  Place the carcass in a stock pot, breaking it up, if necessary, to
  make it fit.  Add water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a
  simmer, and skim off any foam that comes to the surface.
  
  Add the sliced onion, celery, parsley, thyme sprig and bay leaf;
  simmer, uncovered, skimming occasionally, for 2 to 4 hours.  (The
  longer you cook it, the richer the stock will be.)   Do not let the
  stock boil or it will turn cloudy.
  
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast iron), over
  medium heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring and scraping the
  entire bottom of the pan at least every 10 seconds, until the
  resulting roux cooks to a deep mahogany color, 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Adjust the heat to prevent scorching, which can give a bitter taste.
  Turn off the heat and continue stirring a minute or two until the
  mixture no longer gets darker on the bottom.
  
  Carefully stir in the diced vegetables tables; don't let the roux
  splatter it can cause nasty burns.  Stir to coat the vegetables
  evenly with roux; stir in the chile powder, salt, pepper, herbs and
  cayenne; set aside. (The roux may be prepared to this point while the
  stock cooks.) Strain the stock, let it stand until the fat rises to
  the top, and skim off the fat.
  
  Bring 8 cups of the stock to a boil in a large pot, stir in the roux
  vegetable mixture and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15
  minutes.
  
  Add the shrimp, crab and/or oysters and simmer just until done, about
  5 minutes.  Taste for seasoning and correct if necessary. Serve in
  soup bowls over small scoops of rice.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

      Title: LINGUINE TURKEY BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Pasta, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      1    Celery stalk with leaves,
           -finely chopped
      1 md Carrot, finely chopped
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 cl Garlic, finely chopped
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey
      1 tb Dried oregano
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Half-and-half
      1 cn Plum tomatoes, crushed
           -slightly, with juices
           -(28 oz)
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 c  Defatted chicken broth
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
      1 lb Cooked linguine
      2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley,
           -for garnish
 
  To lighten a traditional Bolognese sauce, I substituted lean ground
  turkey for the more traditional ground beef. It's necessary to taste
  and adjust seasonings as you go along, since the flavor of turkey is
  not as strong as beef. I've added a generous amount of oregano and
  garlic for spice and sauteed the meat in extra-virgin olive oil for
  more flavor. Have patience with this sauce - the long, slow simmer is
  what makes it so delicious. Freshly grated Parmesan is perfect to
  serve alongside.
  
  1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
  celery, carrot, onion and garlic, then cook 8-10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  2. Raise heat to medium and add the ground turkey and oregano. Cook
  for about 8 minutes, stirring and breaking up the meat, until it
  begins to brown.
  
  3. Add the wine and simmer for about 10-12 minutes. Add the
  half-and-half and simmer until nearly reduced, about 6-8 minutes.
  
  4. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and broth. Bring to a gentle simmer
  and cook over medium-low heat, partially covered, for 1 hour,
  stirring a few times. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  5. Serve hot over just-cooked linguine and sprinkle with chopped
  parsley.

           -on), thinly sliced
      1    Red bell pepper, cored,
           -seeded and finely chopped
      1 ts Minced garlic
      2 tb Chopped cilantro
    3/4 ts Dried thyme
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Paprika
           Red pepper flakes, to taste
           Salt, to taste
           Black pepper, to taste
      4    Toasted hamburger buns
    1/4 c  Regular or reduced-calorie
           -mayonnaise-type dressing,
           -for garnish (opt)
      1 sm Ripe avacado, sliced, for
           -garnish (opt)
 
  It's necessary to highly season turkey because the meat itself tastes
  rather mild. Yet, once ground turkey is cooked up, it's delicious. To
  do a taste test on the mixture, make a little patty the size of a
  silver dollar and pan-fry it in a nonstick skillet. This way you can
  adjust your seasonings to taste. A mayonnaise-type dressing and
  avacado make perfect toppings.
  
  1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.
  
  2. Place the ground turkey in a bowl and mix well with the scallions,
  bell pepper, garlic, cilantro and spices. Season to taste with salt
  and pepper. Gently form into 4 patties.
  
  3. Grill patties over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 5-6 minutes
  per side.
  
  4. If desired, spread buns with mayonnaise-type dressing and top
  burgers with avacado slices. Serve immediately.

  dressing): 346 calories, 13 grams fat, 62 milligrams cholesterol.

  Slice in 4 slices. Between sheets of plastic wrap, lightly pound
  turkey cutlets into paillardes (thin sheets). Season with Kosher salt
  and pepper.
  
  Divide foie gras (or chopped liver) in 4 parts and season with salt
  and pepper. Place a piece of foie gras in center of each turkey
  paillarde and roll turkey around foie gras.
  
  Carefully remove cabbage leaves, one at a time, first removing core.
  Boil cabbage leaves in a large pot just until wilted, about 3
  minutes, and refresh under cold running water. Dry thoroughly.
  
  For each roulade, lay out 2 or 3 cabbage leaves to form a square.
  Place turkey roulade in center and wrap with cabbage, forming a tight
  bundle. Refrigerate. Sautene sauce: Over high heat, reduce 1 cup of
  sauterne and 1 cup of chicken broth until sauce coats back of spoon
  (about 12 minutes). Sprinkle in 1/3 cup sun-dried cherries.
  
  Crispy sweet potatoes: Peel potato and poach in boiling water until
  just tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and slice very thin and then cut
  into julienne strips. In large saute pan, heat vegetable oil to hot,
  and fry potato strips for 1 minute, or until crisp. Pat dry with
  paper towels and toss with salt and pepper. To serve: Place roulades
  in center of bamboo steamer and steam exactly 15 minutes. Turkey will
  be cooked through and foie gras will be pink in center. Reheat

  For the Chicken:
  ================
  
       To bone the chicken, producing two servings (or globi) per chicken,
  begin by cutting down along the breast bone, scraping along the bone to
  keep the meat intact.  Disjoint the wing and continue boning along the
  wishbone.
  
       Turn the chicken over and cut along the back bone, carving out the
  meat from the bone.  Disjoint the thigh and continue to remove the entire
  half of the chicken with the skin intact.
  
       Cut off the wing at the first joint leaving only the shoulder bone
  attached to the carcass.  Scrape the meat off of this remaining wing bone
  to remove the bone, leaving meat and skin attached to the half chicken.
  
       Remove the thigh bone, leaving meat attached to the chicken half. Cut
  around the knob end of the leg, releasing the skin and the tendons. Press
  the leg meat and skin firmly toward the thigh so that 1 1/2 to 2 inches of
  the leg bone is exposed.  Cut the knob off the end of the leg bone.
  
       Repeat the process with the second half of the chicken.
  
       Marinate the chicken meat for one hour in cognac, thyme and bay leaf.

      Title: VICKI'S TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey, Holiday, Vicki
      Yield: 1 turkey
 
           Turkey
           Butter, melted
           Kahlua
           Apricot preserves
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Rub cleaned turkey with unsalted shortening or butter.  Cover the bird with
  a piece of cheesecloth soaked in melted, unsalted butter. Reduce the heat
  to 350 and place turkey in oven.
  
  Make glaze of equal parts Kahlua and apricot preserves.  Sounds weird, but
  it is delicious.  Baste turkey with glaze right over the top of the
  cheesecloth.  (The taste actually permeates the meat.)
  
  Peel the cloth off before presentation (bird is a dark, rich brown) and
  serve w/ sauce.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  The basic technique is from "Joy of Cooking," although Rombauer says to
  put it on a rack.  The glaze is from the Kahlua company.
  
  *  The only time I used pop-up indicators is when I was given turkeys that
  had them.  I ignored the indicator --> used standard cooking chart for
  weight (should be on turkey).  You know how the turkey keeps cooking even
  when it's not in the oven?  Sure enough, after he had been out of oven long
  enough to serve, the indicator FINALLY popped up!

      Title: SHU MEI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
---DUMPLINGS---
      2 lb Turkey, ground
  1 1/2 ts Cornstarch (cornflour)
  1 1/2 ts Sherry, dry
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Ginger, grated
           -or finely chopped
      6    Green onions, chopped
      6    Garlic cloves,
           -crushed, minced
           -or pressed
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 pk Wonton wrappers
           Peanut oil

-DIPPING SAUCE-
  1 1/2 c  Fish sauce (You may
           -want to dilute this
           -with water, depending
           -on its strength)
      1 c  Vinegar
      1 c  Sugar
      6    Garlic cloves, finely
           -minced or pressed
      1 tb Ginger, finely
           -minced or grated
      1 tb Red pepper, crushed
 
  Make the dipping sauce by mixing together all of its ingredients.  Store in
  the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.
  
  Stir together everything but the wrappers and the peanut oil.  Mix
  vigorously by hand until it begins to bind together. (About 1 minute or
  so.)
  
  Place about 1 1/2 - 2 T of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper.  Fold
  the sides up around the meat so that you have a little bag or cup.  Press
  the bottom flat so that the bag doesn't fall over.
  
  Oil racks of the steamer with peanut oil.  Place dumplings in racks.  Steam
  for 15 to 20 minutes in covered rack over boiling water.  Serve hot with
  dipping sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Steamed dumplings (meatballs) -- This recipe is an adaptation of the one
  in "The Frugal Gourmet" by Jeff Smith. The bigger the batch, the better.
  There are never leftovers. Yield: makes 35-40.
  
  *  These little gems would probably go just fine with a favorite hoisin or
  chili dipping sauce.
  
  *  The steamer racks I recommend are the Chinese bamboo ones.  You can
  stack them quite nicely (I find that three racks work well) and they sit at
  just the right height above the boiling water in a wok. The real advantage
  is that water will not condense on your food if you use a bamboo steamer.
  
  *  The dipping sauce is an adaption of one served at the Phoenix Vietnamese
  restaurant in Saint Paul Minnesota; it was originally served with egg
  rolls, but works splendidly with these dumplings.
  
  *  The original recipe calls for ground pork, but I find ground turkey
  preferable.  The flavor is lighter and the calories far fewer.  Pork is
  fine, though, and even hamburger could be used in a pinch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but tedious.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

           Giblets and gizzard
           -from 1 turkey
           Leaves from 4
           -celery stalks
      1    Celery stalk
      1 sm Onion, quartered
     12 c  Water

----DRESSING----
     12 oz Bread cubes (herbed)
      1 lg Yellow onion,
           -chopped fine
      3    Celery stalks,
           -chopped fine
      3 c  Rice, cooked (cooled
           -uncovered overnight
           -in a shallow dish)

           Salt
           Black pepper
           Rubbed sage
           Thyme
 
  MAKE CORNBREAD:  The night before, make the cornbread.  Preheat oven to 425
  degrees F.
  
  Thinly coat the bottom of a standard Pyrex pie plate, or 9-inch square
  baking pan, with vegetable oil. Put pan in oven while it is preheating and
  you are mixing the cornbread batter.
  
  In a mixing bowl, blend together the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking
  powder. Stir in the egg and about 3 T vegetable oil. Add milk and mix
  thoroughly by hand. The consistency should be a thick, but not "doughy,"
  liquid.  It may be necessary to add a little more milk. Pour into preheated
  pan and bake for 30 minutes or until slightly brown on top.
  
  Let cool in pan for 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and break up into very
  large chunks in a large mixing bowl. Let stand overnight, uncovered. This
  will ensure that it is dry and stale.
  
  MAKE TURKEY BROTH:  The night before, make the turkey broth.  Bring about
  12 C of water to a boil in a large pot. Thoroughly rinse turkey neck,
  giblets and gizzard. Add turkey parts, onion, celery leaves and celery
  stalk to water, cover and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer on very low
  heat for 2 hours. Strain the broth, cover, cool quickly and refrigerate.

      Title: ROAST TURKEY WITH CHESTNUT STUFFING
 Categories: Harned 1994, Main dish, Nuts, Pork, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Fresh turkey; with giblets
           -- (10 to 12 lbs.)
      4 tb Unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
           -- at room temperature
      1 lb Fresh chestnuts; peeled*
      3 c  ;Water
      1 lb Pork sausage
      2    Shallots; peeled
           -- finely chopped
    1/4 c  Fresh parsley; fine chopped
      4    Fresh thyme sprigs or
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and minced
      2    Eggs; beaten
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 lg Onions; peeled
           -- each cut into 8 wedges
      4 md Carrots; peeled
           -- cut in 2" pieces
 
  *To peel chestnuts, make a small cut on the flat side of each
  chestnut, making sure to cut all the way through the outer skin.
  Place chestnuts in a medium-size saucepan, cover with water, and
  bring to a boil over high heat.  Then reduce heat to low.  Remove
  several chestnuts from the water and peel them with a sharp paring
  knife, being sure to remove both the outer peel and the dark inner
  skin that is attached to the meat.  If the chestnuts cool before you
  have a chance to peel them, place them back in the water to heat, as
  it is virtually impossible to remove the inner skin when the chestnut
  is cool.
  
  Remove giblets and neck from the turkey; set aside.  Rinse the turkey
  well inside and out until the water runs clear.  Pat it thoroughly
  dry. Carefully separate the skin from the breast by running your
  fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to poke any
  holes in the skin.  Spread the butter on the meat.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a vegetable steamer over high heat.  Add
  the chestnuts, cover, and steam until they are tender, about 30
  minutes. Remove the steamer basket from the heat.
  
  In a medium-size bowl, gently break the chestnuts into bite-size
  pieces. Mixing well after each addition, stir in the pork, shallots,
  herbs, salt and pepper, garlic and eggs.  Chop giblets and add them
  to the mixture, mixing well.  To test for seasoning, pinch off a
  teaspoon of the mixture and cook it in a small skillet over medium
  heat until it is cooked through.  Taste for seasoning and adjust
  accordingly.
  
  Fill the turkey with as much stuffing as it will hold, but don't pack
  it tightly.  Truss the turkey.  Place the turkey in a large roasting
  pan, and pour wine around it.  Roast at 350 F. until turkey is
  golden, basting every 30 minutes with pan liquids.  If the breast is
  browning too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.  After 2
  hours, add the onions and carrots to the pan, spacing them evenly
  around the turkey.  The turkey is done when the skin is golden, the
  thigh is tender when pressed, and the leg joints move easily up and
  down in their sockets, 3 to 3 1/2 hours more.
  
  Remove turkey from the oven and from the roasting pan; let it rest
  for at least 30 minutes or as long as 45 minutes before carving.
  While it is resting, turn the turkey over so it is resting on its
  breast.  Prop the legs so they are slightly higher than the breast,
  allowing juices to run back into the breast meat.  Reduce the cooking
  juices slightly over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes, scraping up
  any brown bits.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain juices
  and pour into a gravy boat.
  
  Scoop out the stuffing into a serving dish and keep warm while you
  carve the turkey.  Serve; pass the gravy boat.
  
  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
  
  The stuffing is good for any poultry, and can be cooked on its own and
  served as a side dish to pork roast as well.  To cook the stuffing
  separately, bake it in a covered dish at 350 F. until it is nearly
  cooked all the way through, about 30 minutes.  Then remove the cover
  and continue cooking until it has browned slightly on top and is
  clearly cooked through, an additional 10 to 15 minutes.  If you cook
  the stuffing separately, your turkey may take slightly less time to
  cook.
  
  Also good accompanied by either a red Burgundy or a Volnay.

  2 1/4 c  Chicken broth, defatted
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
    1/4 c  Chopped onions
      2 md Carrots, coarsely chopped
      3 tb Cornstarch
  1 3/4 c  Evaporated skim milk
      3 c  Cooked, chopped turkey

      1 c  Frozen peas, thawed
    1/4 c  Snipped fresh parsley
    1/2 ts Dried sage

--PASTRY CRUST--
      3    Sheets phyllo dough
 
  To Make the Turkey Mixture:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium
  saucepan, combine 2 cups of the broth, the celery, onions and carrots.
  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes or
  until the veggies are tender.  In a custard cup, stir the remaining 1/4 cup
  of the broth and the cornstarch until smooth. Slowly stir this into the
  broth-veggie mxiture.  Then stir in the milk. Cook and stir over medium
  heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Reuce the heat. Cook and stir for 1
  minute more. Then stir in the turkey, peas, parsely and sage. Transfer the
  mixture to a shallow 2-quart casserole.
  
  To Make the Pastry Crust:  Lay one sheet of the phyllo dough on top of the
  turkey mixture.  Spray the dough with no stick spray.  Repeat layering and
  spraying the phyllo dough two more times.  Fold or crumple the edges of the
  dough and tuck them inside the casserole dish.  Bake for 35-40 minutes or
  until golden brown.
  
  I added potatoes, mixed veggies, tobasco sauce and some liquid smoke to
  enhance the flavor.  Very good and light.  Even though the phyllo dough
  crust will get soft once you refrigerate it, it will get flaky again if you
  reheat it in the oven.

      1    Doubled Recipe corn bread
           - Prepare a week before and
           - break up to dry
  1 1/2    Loaves GOOD white bread
           - Begin drying w/corn bread
           - one week before.
     20 lb Turkey
  2 1/2 lg Onions, diced
           Celery hearts and leaves,
           - diced to equal same amount
           - as onions
           Chicken broth
           Butter
           Water
           Salt and pepper
           Sage
      6    Eggs
           Flour
 
  One week before: Bake a 9 x 13 pan of corn bread. Cool. Break into chunks
  and put in very large Tupperware container or large roasting pan. Add 1 &
  1/2 loaves of bread - spread slices for drying moving around daily, and
  breaking up as the slices dry out.  Use good bread ~ the cheap stuff is NOT
  as good! Keep covered with a clean dish towel, do NOT seal with lid.
  PREPARATION AND COOKING:  Clean a a thawed turkey (thaw in the refrigerator
  about 3-4 days for a 20 pound turkey). Place the turkey breast DOWN in a
  large roasting pan (enamel is great). Add the neck and giblets. Slice about
  2 sticks of butter and place these all over the turkey. Open one can
  chicken broth and pour in the bottom of the pan.
  If the roaster lid fits, use it to cover the turkey.  If it doesn't, make
  a cover with heavy foil by tearing off two pieces of foil about 12 inches
  longer than the pan and make a "sealed" fold along the lengthwise edges.
  Put over the turkey like a tent - that is, leave some space in the center
  rather than having the foil touch the turkey. Pinch the edges of the foil
  tightly around all edges to seal juices in as turkey bakes.
  Bake in a 325 degree oven until about 1 hour BEFORE the turkey is
  completely done!  You'll have to check a 20 lb turkey in about 2 1/2 hours
  or 3 hours. If your turkey is TOO done, it will not be as good. Ideally,
  the meat should not be falling away from the bones.
  Set a timer for 2 1/2 hours... and about 1 hour before you think the
  turkey is ready for adding the stuffing, begin preparing it.  Do NOT
  prepare too far ahead of time.
  Dice the onions and celery hearts/leaves (if you don't have hearts, use
  lots of leaves - this is one of the "secrets" of my stuffing). Together,
  the onions and celery should equal at least 6 cups, more or less.
  Remove the turkey carefully.  Move the turkey to another container (I use
  the roaster lid or an aluminum baking pan). Pour the broth through a
  strainer into the sauce pan you'll be using to make the gravy. Retain the
  rest for the stuffing. If more liquid is needed, use cans of chicken broth
  and/or 1 stick of butter to 1 cup of water. Into a large container (I use
  the huge Tupperware bowl), put the dried corn bread, bread, onions &
  celery. Pour in any left-over broth. This may be hot, so wait for it to
  cool.  Mix with a large wooden spoon. Add enough chicken broth to cool the
  mixture enough that it can be mixed with your hands. Each hardened piece of
  corn bread and bread should be smashed with your fingers. When the mixture
  is cool enough that it won't cook the eggs, add the eggs. Remember to break
  the eggs into another container. This will prevent egg shells in your
  stuffing!!! (Eggs in stuffing: Another secret.) Add salt, lots of pepper,
  and lots of sage.  Mix by hand, adding more broth as needed for a nice
  thick and moist mixture - not too sloppy. Taste it! This is where YOUR
  judgment comes into play.  The stuffing should have a hint of pepper, and a
  definite taste of sage.
  When the stuffing looks right and tastes right, start putting it in the
  bottom of the roaster. Put in enough so that you have about 1/2" of
  stuffing in the pan. Now place the turkey ON TOP of the stuffing, breast
  UP. Continue adding the stuffing all around the turkey.  If you have
  enough, you can completely bury the turkey in stuffing! Bury the neck and
  giblets in the stuffing - push then in and cover them.
  (My favorite part of the turkey is the neck - no one in my family DARES to
  use it in gravy!)  If you want giblet gravy (ugh!) hold back the giblets
  and do your thing with them.
  Cover as before, return to the oven for about 2 hours, or until celery and
  onions are tender.  Make gravy by adding a couple of large scoops of
  stuffing into the retained broth. Make thickening of flour and water (or
  cornstarch) to thicken your gravy as desired.  If you don't have enough
  broth, open another can of Chicken broth!
  This turkey is NOT "pretty as a picture" but I guarantee it's the most
  delicious way in the world to prepare turkey and stuffing (or chicken and
  stuffing).  Clem's grandmother raised fourteen children and this was the
  only way to prepare enough "dressing" for the entire family. Of course, she
  cooked her meals in a wood cook stove.  This method of preparation was
  handed down to Clem's mother who then taught it to me....Joyce Kohl

      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
      1 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Ground nutmeg

MAIN INGREDIENTS
      4 T  Unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
    1/2 c  Green bell peppers, chopped
    1/4 c  Green onions, finely chopped
      2 t  Minced garlic
      1 T  Tabasco sauce
      1 T  Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Evaporated milk
    1/2 c  Catsup
  1 1/2 lb Ground beef
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      2 ea Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 c  Very fine bread crumbs
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions,
  celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and
  seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6
  minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in
  the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room
  temperature.
  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add
  the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the
  bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the
  pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6
  inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes,
  then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes
  longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.
  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives
  more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.

  imagination.remember that no one spice should predominate. Shape the meat
  into 1 1/2 inch balls and flour them lightly. Drop them into 3 pints of
  boiling water and cook slowly for 1 1/2 hours. At the end of this time
  thicken the stock with 1/2 cup of browned flour. Browned flour may be
  added directly to stock without being mixed to a paste if the stock is
  boiling there will be no lumps. The stock will jell when cool and your
  ragout de boulettes will keep for some time.

    1/2 t  Salt
    1/4 t  White pepper
    1/4 t  Onion powder
    1/4 t  Garlic powder
    1/4 t  Cayenne pepper

---VEGETABLES---
  1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note
      1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)
      1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
 
    NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut these
    into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips that have
    skin on one surface.  Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
    In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork.  Mix
    in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed.  Set
    aside.    In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter,
    the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco and
    meat seasoning mix.  Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
    frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and
    cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to
    the meat and mix well by hand.  Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and center
    in the pan.  Bake at 450F until brown on top, about 30 minutes.
    Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons.  Set
    meat and drippings aside.    Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork
    tender; drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water.  Place the
    potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1
    stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white pepper.  Stir with a
    wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or
    electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.  (NOTE:
    Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
    enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the
    reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning
    mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the
    zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing until vegetables are
    noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
    occasionally.  Remove from heat.    Mound undrained vegetables on top
    of the meat loaf, away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes
    evenly over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the meat, using
    all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10
    minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce
    (see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana

  oil for 8-to-10 minutes, until the pork is no longer pink; do not brown the
  meat. Add the asparagus, toss for 1-or-2 minutes over moderate heat, then
  allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. In a separate bowl, combine
  the remaining ingredients, except the vegetable oil, to make a dipping
  sauce. When the pork mixture is cool, stir it into the reserved batter.
  Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat until
  ripples show on the skillet bottom. Half fill a 1/4-cup measuring cup with
  the batter and drop the batter into the hot oil, evening up the ragged
  edges of the pancake. Add 3 more pancakes to the skillet, smoothing the
  edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes per side. Drain them
  on paper towels, then keep them warm on an uncovered platter in a 250F
  oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes, adding more vegetable oil to the
  skillet if needed. Serve the pancakes hot with the dipping sauce.

      Title: BROWN 'N' SERVE SAUSAGE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork
    1/4 c  Cracker crumbs
    1/4 c  Water
      1 ts Sage
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Ground cloves
 
  The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.
  
  Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt, thyme,
  oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined.
  
  Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
  patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.)  Place in a cold,
  lightly oiled frypan.
  
  Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
  beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.
  
  Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in
  refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months.  Or cook a second
  time and serve immediately.
  
  To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook over
  medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages are brown
  and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner, allowing about 2 min
  longer for cooking.

  Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the frying
  pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the fat and blot
  with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking dish (try 8"
  pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top with about 2 1/4 cups
  seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until crumbs are lightly browned.

      6 oz Shrimp, shelled and deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil

    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           -chestnuts, preferably fresh

      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
 
  These dumplings make great finger food for a cocktail party. They can be
  prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before serving. The
  wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a unique
  translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll out the wrappers
  as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
  Wheat Starch Wrappers (see recipe) Vegetable oil Light soy sauce, for
  dipping Chinese mustard, for dipping
  
  Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and pliable.
  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off the stems
  at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
  Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well with
  cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
  Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium- high
  heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling
  to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
  Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of dough.
  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle. An oiled
  Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press or a
  rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of the
  circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling inside.
  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
  Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

  board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp knife if you
  don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished, should be slightly
  finer than hamburger.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling skin. Then
  bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much as possible,
  without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need, with
  the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming 10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.
  
  *  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are round
  and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by merely cutting
  off the corners to round off the skin.

    1/4 c  Water
      1 lb Ground chuck
    2/3 lb Coarsely ground pork
      1 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, whole
    1/2 ts Dried basil
    1/2 c  Beef stock
 
  Crush the garlic well in the water, using a fork. Stir the meat,
  baking soda, seasonings, and garlic puree together. Add Beef Stock
  and mix well. For each sausage, take 1/3 cup of the meat mixture, and
  roll between the palms of your hands into a sausage shape about 4
  inches long. Place sausages side by side in a container and cover.
  Refrigerate overnight so that the flavors can blend.
  These are excellent on the grill. They may also be broiled or baked
  in the oven. Broil the sausages about 3 minutes per side until cooked
  through and browned..
  HINT: When hand rolling sausages or meatballs of any kind, keep a
  small bowl of water near you so that you can keep your hands a bit
  wet. This way the meat will not stick to your hands.

      Title: PUSIT RELLENO
 Categories: Mexican, Seafood
      Yield: 6 servings
 
STUFFED CALAMARI
     12 lg Squids
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      3    Green onions, finely sliced
      1    Egg, beaten
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1 md Tomato, chopped
    1/2    Bay leaf
      1 tb Soy sauce
 
  Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and inside.
  Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside.
  In a large bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a little
  salt and pepper.
  Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and slippery, don't
  over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell when cooking. A pastry
  bag makes this easier to do.
  Place a pan in a steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15 minutes,
  or until filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside.
  Prepare sauce while steaming calamari.  In a skillet over medium heat,
  saute garlic in oil until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1 minute.
  Add tomato, bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomato
  pieces are soft.
  Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari.  Serve with rice.
  Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir fry
  them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from steaming the
  calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good dish to serve to
  people who don't like calamari or are a bit squeamish.
  Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm and green.

     10    Napa cabbage leaves, chopped
           -and ends removed
      2    Stalks bok choi, chopped

      1 lb Ground pork, cooked
      1 lb Small shrimp, cooked
    1/2 lb Ground beef, cooked
    1/4 c  Cooking wine
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb Sesame oil
      1 pk Egg roll skins or wrappers
           Oil for frying
      1    Egg, beaten
 
  Mix filling ingredients together. Put mixture in the freezer awhile to
  cool. Warm meat tends to soften the wrappers and make things messy.
  Heat vegetable oil in fryer to 325 degrees.
  To roll, place about 3 tb filling mixture in the center of the wrapper.
  Fold 1 corner over mixture and fold in ends. Continue rolling. Brush egg
  mixture on exposed corner of wrapper to help seal egg roll.
  Put egg rolls in hot oil, a few at a time, and fry a few minutes on each
  side until golden brown. Remove to drain on paper towels. Serve warm with
  soy sauce, hot mustard, or sauce of your choice. Makes 18 egg rolls.
 

 

 
      Title: EGG PANCAKE ROLLS WITH PORK FILLING
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Breakfast
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4    Eggs
      1 tb Dry sherry
           Carrots, finely chopped
           (for garnish)

----FILLING----
      1 c  (about 1/2 lb) ground pork,
           Uncooked
      2 md Fresh mushrooms,
           Chopped fine
      2    Scallions, chopped fine
           (white parts separate from
           The green)
      2 ts Cornstarch, dissolved in
      2 tb Water, cold
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Peanut oil

SAUCE
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Plum sauce
           Dash hot chili oil or
           Tabasco
           Sauce
 
  In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl, combine all
  the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of the chopped
  scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to blend well. In a
  8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a quarter of the egg
  mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet.  Heat until the egg pancake has
  barely set, then transfer to a plate.  Make 3 more pancakes. Divide the
  filling into 4 portions and put a portions on each pancake. Moisten your
  fingers with cold water and spread the filling mixture evenly over the
  surface of the pancake, then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll.
  Seal with a little leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls
  on a flat plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an
  inch of simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
  ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the slant.
  Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens and the
  carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

      1 tb Oil

  Boil wrapper. Remove from heat and pour in 1 1/2 cup flour and beat until
  it forms a ball.  Divide into 1 1/4 inch balls and roll each until paper
  thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and seal. Arrange in
  steamer and steam 30 minutes.
  
       Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker wrappers
  (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1 inch thick) and
  the filling can be just about anything.  I have done these with leftover
  meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms, celery etc.

      Title: FUN GWAU (STEAMED TRANSLUCENT DUMPLINGS)
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Chinese
      Yield: 30 servings
 
      6    Dried Chinese black
           Mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled & deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           Chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           Sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           Coriander leaves
      1    Oil
           Wheat Starch Wrappers
           (see recipe)
           Light soy sauce, for
           Dipping
           Chinese mustard, for
           Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a
  unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors.  Roll out the
  wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms.  Cut off
  the stems at the base and discard them.  Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes.  Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly.  Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce.  Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok.  Stir fry for 1 minute longer.  Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander.  Allow the
  filling to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.
  An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press
  or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of
  the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling
  inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate).  Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes.  Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Title: PASTA WITH PORK & BASIL
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Pasta, Pork
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta
      6 oz Mushrooms
           Fresh basil, parsley, chives

----FOR THE MEATBALLS----
      1 lb Lean freshly minced pork
           Parmesan cheese
           Fresh basil
           Garlic
    1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
           A little butter or oil

-FOR THE SAUCE-
    1/2 oz Butter
  1 1/2 tb Plain flour
    1/4 pt Double cream
    1/2 pt (scant) stock
           Parmesan cheese
           Dijon mustard
 
  Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
  tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
  clove, as well as salt and pepper.  Flour your hands and shape the mixture
  into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan for 5 minutes
  or more until golden and cooked right through.  Shake the pan frequently so
  the meatballs keep in good shape and cook evenly.  Transfer to a casserole
  and keep hot.
  
      Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
  meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock.  Make a
  smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream.  Add any juices
  that have collected in the casserole and simmer for several minutes. Away
  from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1
  heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard.  Pour the sauce over the meatballs, cover
  and keep hot in a low oven.  The mixture can be kept hot for some time
  without spoiling, or it can be prepared ahead and reheated close to
  serving.
  
      Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the casserole
  together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2 tablespoons each
  basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss gently to mix well. Garnish
  with more basil, and serve with an undressed salad.

 Categories: Thai, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 ts Oil
      1 lb Ground pork
      4    -to
      8    Garlic cloves
           -- finely chopped
      3    Green onions, white part
           -- chopped
    3/4 c  Roasted salted peanuts
      1    Fresh pineapple; -OR-
      5    -Tangerines, -OR-
      4    -Oranges
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Pepper
           Lettuce leaves
           Mint or coriander leaves
           Chopped chilis
 
  Grind peanuts.  Heat oil in a frying pan, add pork, garlic and onions. Cook
  until pink color disappears.  Drain off most of the fat.  Add sugar and
  pepper, cook 1-2 minutes.  Add peanuts, mix in well, then remove from heat.
  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves.  Peel and segment the citrus
  fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and fanning open to
  form a circle.  If using pineapple, cut off top leaves and outer skin, as
  thinly as possible, from top down.  Look at the "eye" pattern, as it forms
  a spiral down the pineapple.  Cut the spirals with a sharp knife held at
  about a 45 degree angle.  Cut off bottom.  Cut pineapple into about 5 or 6
  wedges and then cut each of those into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange fruit on
  platter.
  
  Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes.  Serve at
  room temperature, or chilled.

 Categories: Mexican, Pork
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 ts Chilled margarine
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Ice water
      2 oz Cooked ground pork, crumbled
           -(OR finely chopped

  In small bowl, with pastry blender or 2 knives, cut margarine into flour
  until mixture resembles corn meal; sprinkle with ice water and, using fork,
  mix to form soft dough.  Roll dough between 2 sheets of wax paper to form
  rectangle about 1/4 inch thick; remove paper and use 2-inch diameter plain
  or fluted cookie cutter to cut dough into rounds.  Roll scraps of dough and
  continue cutting until all dough has been used (should yield 24 rounds).
  Combine pork (or ham), cheese, mustard, and red pepper in small bowl and

  Beat egg white lightly and brush an equal amount onto each pastry round.
  Spoon an equal amount of the meat mixture (about 1/2 rounded teaspoon) onto
  center of each round; fold pastry over, turnover-fashion, to enclose
  filling.  Press edges of dough together to seal.  Transfer turnovers to
  nonstick cookie sheet.  Add milk to egg yolk and beat lightly; brush an
  equal amount of mixture over each turnover and sprinkle each with a dash of
  paprika.  Bake until turnovers are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer
  to warmed serving tray; garnish with red pepper strips and cilantro. Chili
  sauce or salsa can be served as a dipping sauce.
  
  Makes 8 servings of 3 turnovers each.

  gnocchi, pour flour onto work surface and make a well in the centre. Pour
  in the olive oil.  Dissolve saffron in a bit of warm water and add to well.
  Mix liquid with flour, adding enough water to form a firm, not sticky,
  dough.  You'll have to add the water 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough is
  the right consistency.  Cut dough into pieces and roll into long cylinders,
  about 1/2 inch diameter.  Cut into 1-inch chunks and press your finger into
  each gnocchi to make a deep dent. Set gnocchi aside on a floured surface to
  dry while you make the sauce. Heat pork fat in saute pan and cook the onion
  and parsley until tender. Stir in the ground meat and cook until no longer
  pink.  Add the chopped tomatoes, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Cook,
  uncovered, for an hour or until the sauce is thickened. Cook gnocchi in
  boiling salted water until cooked al dente.  Drain and arrange in pasta
  dishes.  Pour sauce over top and garnish with a handful of grated cheese.

    250 g  Ground beef (a generous 1/2
           -lb)
    100 g  Plain breadcrumbs (3.5 oz)
      2    Eggs
      1    Onion, finely chopped

           Water for pan gravy
 
  Mix the ground meat with all the other ingredients [except for the lard,
  the sliced yellow turnip, sliced onion, and whole garlic cloves] and shape
  into a rectangular loaf.  Put in a casserole dish with the lard, the sliced
  onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced yellow turnip.  Roast at 390 degrees
  F until the onions turn brown.  Then, add a little bit of water. Continue
  to roast, basting frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is
  getting too dark, cover the top of the meatloaf with aluminum foil.  In the
  olden days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the
  same effect.
  
  At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may be
  served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan juices.
  
  Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].
  
  Serves 4.

    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  1.  Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5 minutes in a large
  mixing bowl.

  heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the onions and saute them for
  about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly.
  
  3.  Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt, pepper, and onions to the
  bread-crumb mixture. Gently combine the ingredients with your hands.
  
  4.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a couple of hours.
  
  5.  Shape the meat mixture with your hands into uniform 2/3-inch balls.

  sides. Turn them as necessary, but do so gently.

           Coriander leaves
      1    Oil
           Wheat Starch Wrappers
           (see recipe)
           Light soy sauce, for
           Dipping
           Chinese mustard, for
           Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a
  unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll out the
  wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off
  the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling
  to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.
  An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press
  or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of
  the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling
  inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh ginger root, minced

MIXTURE FOR SKIN
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Medium sherry
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
 
  Prepare Chicken:  Trim excess fat from chicken; remove wing tips. Mix
  mixture for skin; rub chicken inside & out with it. Leave uncovered at room
  temperature, while coating is absorbed and dried. Repeat if necessary.
  
  Stuffing:  In hot wok, heat peanut oil to smoking. Stir-fry ground pork 2
  minutes; add mustard green, ginger & sugar; stir-fry 1 more minute. Remove
  & cool.
  
  Lotus Leaves:  Number of leaves depends on their size & that of chicken.
  Reduce heat under boiling water to simmer, & steep leaves for 3-5 minutes,
  until wet through & pliable (no longer or leaves may shred). Now soak in
  cold water for 10 minutes, or longer, until time to use them; open folded
  leaves in cold water to wash them.
  
  Wrap Chicken:  Preheat oven to 550 degrees.  Stuff chicken with pork
  mixture. Cut hard center out of lotus leaves, then slit along fold about 3"
  on each side of center, so cut away center can be overlapped. Wrap chicken
  in 3 layers of lotus leaves.  Tie securely with piece of cotton or fiber
  string (don't use nylon; it might melt). Spread soft, wet modeling clay
  about 1/2" thick on sheet of newspaper.  Bring clay pack around chicken &
  seal.  Remove newspaper. (Use foil if clay unavailable.)
  
  Roasting:  Place clay-covered chicken on rack in shallow roasting pan in
  preheated oven.  Bake for 1 hour; reduce heat to 350 degrees & bake for
  another 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Serve:  Present fired clay chicken to table.  Crack clay with suitable
  object, allowing some of steam to escape before you proceed. Remove clay;
  carefully cut open lotus leaves with scissors. Chicken will be very soft &
  tender; break apart to get at stuffing.  Serve guests, or invite them to
  pick with chopsticks.

  and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by merely cutting
  off the corners to round off the skin.

      2 tb Fish sauce
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2    Limes, juice only
      3 tb Vinegar
    1/4 c  Brown sugar or half brown
           -and half palm sugar
           Oil, for deep-frying
      6 oz Rice sticks
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 md Onion, finely diced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 sm Red or green chile, seeds
           -removed, finely minced
    3/4 lb Minced pork, diced chicken,

           -mixture
      2    Green onions, sliced, for
           -garnish
 
  This special occasion noodle dish is a favorite in many Thai restaurants.
  Some versions are extremely sweet and sticky; this version is less so, but
  the important flavors are still sweet, sour, and salty in that order. Be
  sure to use a large enough pan for saucing the noodles (step 5); a 14-inch
  wok is ideal.
  
  1. In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, and
  sugar and set aside.
  
  2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Drop approximately
  an ounce of rice sticks into the oil; they will puff up and rise to the top
  of the oil in only a few seconds. Turn them over once and fry until crisp,
  about 15 seconds in all. Transfer finished noodles to a pan lined with
  paper towels and continue frying the batter in small batches. Keep noodles
  warm in a low oven.
  
  3. Dip a hand in the beaten egg and, holding your hand approximately 8
  inches above the hot oil, drizzle egg over the surface in a random pattern.
  Continue with about half the egg mixture, forming a lacy network of egg.
  Fry until golden brown on underside, turn over once, and brown other side.
  Transfer to a plate and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining egg.
  
  4. Heat a second wok over medium high heat and add approximately 2
  tablespoons oil from the first wok. Add onion, garlic, and chile and cook
  until they are fragrant. Add meats or shrimp and stir-fry just until done.
  
  5. Stir sugar mixture and add to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until
  slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low and add about a quarter of the fried
  noodles and eggs. Stir together and toss to break up noodle clumps and coat
  with sauce. Continue adding noodles and eggs in batches until all are
  coated with sauce. Transfer to serving platter and garnish with sliced
  green onion.

      Title: RED PEPPER SWORDFISH
 Categories: Fish, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Swordfish steaks
           -(each about 1/2 lb
           -and about 1 inch thick)
      1 lg Sweet red pepper
      2    Lemons
      3 tb Oregano, fresh
      1 c  Olive oil
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper,
           -fresh ground
           White wine, dry
 
  Remove seeds and ribs from pepper and cut into 1/4 inch cubes.  Put in a
  bowl and mix well with the juice of the two lemons, the olive oil, salt,
  pepper and the oregano.
  
  Heat broiler and pour wine to a depth of about 1/8 inch in a broiler pan.
  Lay swordfish steaks in wine and broil for 3 minutes. Pour the seasoned
  lemon, oil and oregano mixture over the fish and cook for 3 to 4 minutes
  more (until fish is cooked through and lightly browned.) Immediately
  transfer fish to a warmed serving dish.
  
  You may need to reduce the sauce slightly by boiling vigorously and
  stirring for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over fish and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Swordfish steaks cooked with sweet red peppers -- This recipe was handed
  out to people buying swordfish at my local fishmonger; I tried it and it
  was delicious. It is also very quick and simple to make.
  
  *  I served fresh asparagus with this, but any light vegetable would be
  fine. Boiled new potatoes would be nice, too.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      2 c  Finely diced vegetables
           (such as yellow squash,

           Pepper)
  1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh basil leaves
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
      1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           Leaves
      1    11.5 oz can V-8 juice
    1/4 c  Fat-free chicken stock
    1/4 ts White pepper
           HERBED COUSCOUS:
  1 1/2 c  Fat-free chicken stock
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           Leaves
      1 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Couscous
           SWORDFISH:
  1 1/2 lb Fresh swordfish (4 6-oz
           Pieces)
           Sprigs of fresh thyme or
           Rosemary, for garnish (opt.)
 
  To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan over
  medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to sizzle; do
  not brown.  Add the herbs, juice, stock and peper and bring to a boil.
  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes.  Set aside.
  
  To make the couscous, combine the stock, pepper, herbs and oil in a small
  saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the couscous, mix well and remove from
  the heat.  Cover tightly and allow to stand for at least 5 minutes, or
  until all of the liquid has been absorbed.  Set aside.
  
  Wash the swordfish and pat it dry.  Rub the surface with a little olive
  oil and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper and herbs, if
  desired.  Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just until it
  turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Do not
  overcook or the fish will become tough.
  
  To serve, place a rounded 1/2 cup of couscous on each of 4 plates and top
  with a piece of grilled swordfish.  Spoon the minestrone around each
  serving, dividing it equally.  Garnish each serving with a sprig of fresh
  thyme or rosemary, if desired.
