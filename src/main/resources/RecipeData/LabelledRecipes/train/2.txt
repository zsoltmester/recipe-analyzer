      3 T  Oregano; fresh or 1 tbsp dr
  Several hours before serving-or the day before, if time allows, rub
  the chicken pieces pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep
  china or earthenware bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the
  garlic clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate
  the chicken.  Turn chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook,
  preheat the broiler to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces
  on the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted butter
  mixture.  (Reserve part of the basting mixture to serve over the
  chicken when served.)  Broil the chicken 3-4 inches from the heat for
  5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices run
  clear when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove to serving platter,
  pour reserved basting mixture over the chicken breasts and serve
  immediately. This is also good done on a BBQ.
      Title: CHAMPAGNE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
      3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned
      2 T  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter
    1/4 c  Champagne; dry
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 T  Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)
      1 x  Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 x  ----optional ingredients----
      6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin
      3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
      1 T  Butter or margarine
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
  chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
  large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
  cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
  minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a simmer.
  Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or over
  rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish of
  Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place each
  half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat tenderizer
  until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until tender. Divide
  shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading evenly over
  each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half, fold in half,
  and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes on each side in
  the butter and olive oil listed in the original ingredients. Chicken
  is done when it springs back when lightly pressed with finger. Follow
  the balance of the instructions listed above for the sauce. Source:

      Title: CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPICY SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
    1/2 c  Peanuts; raw
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2 ea Whole chicken breasts at roo
      1 ea Large egg white
  1 1/2 T  Water chestnut flour
      1 x  -sauce--
      4 ea Green onions
      2 ea Large cloves garlic
      1 T  Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 T  Sesame oil
    1/2 T  Chinese red vingear
    1/2 T  Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 t  Chili paste with garlic
      1 T  Dry sherry
      1 ea Pinch sugar
      1 ea Cornstarch paste
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  +++++ Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
  white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in
  2-quart saucepan. Reserve. Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken
  meat from bones.  Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1"
  chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water
  chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg
  beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
  thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a
  lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
  (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a
  light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or
  paper bag. Reserve. Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk
  first:  chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2
  minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry
  no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to
  keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long
  chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:  While deep-frying
  chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions & peanuts about a
  minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken pieces to
  sauce, mix quickly & serve.
      Title: CHICKEN MILANESE
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
      4 ea Chicken breast halves; skin
    3/4 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
      2 T  Parmesan; freshly grated
    3/4 c  Breadcrumbs; fresh white
      1 T  Parsley; minced fresh
    1/8 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Pepper; freshly ground
      1 ea Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 c  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter; unsalted
      2 T  Lemon juice; fresh
      1 ea Lemon; quartered
      1 x  Parsley springs; fresh
  Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of
  3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling pin.  Mix cheese, breadcrumbs,
  minced parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in
  medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb
  mixture, coating completely and pressing to adhere.  Shake off excess
  breadcrumbs.  Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add
  chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4
  minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels and drain.
  Transfer chicken to platter. Melt butter in small saucepan. Mix in
  lemon juice and pour over chicken.  Garnish with lemon wedges and
  parsley sprigs. *** My notes:  I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and
  breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I reduced
  the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for 6
  breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
  enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

  dollop of sour cream, and then rolling it up.
  TIME-SAVERS:
  MICROWAVE TIP: Just before serving, stack the tortillas and wrap them in a
  damp paper towel. Cook at 100% for 1 minute.
  DO-AHEAD: Since the fajitas are fine served at room temperature, much of
  the preparation can be done ahead of time. The sauce (Step 5) can be
  made and the chicken marinated in advance. Just be sure to cook the
  chicken and warm the tortillas as close to serving time as possible.

      In a large bowl, combine the allspice, thyme, cayenne pep- per,

  With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar,
  orange juice, and lime juice.  Add the Scotch bonnet pepper,. onion,
  and green onions and mix well.  Add the chicken breasts, cover and
  marinate for at least 1 hour,  longer if possible.
      Preheat an outdoor grill.
      Remove the breasts from the marinade and grill for 6 minutes on
  each side or until fully cooked.  While grilling, baste with the
  marinade.
      Heat the leftover marinade and serve on the side for dipping.
      NOTE:  This is the recipe as listed in the cookbook.  Per-
  sonally, I would NEVER heat the leftover marinade and serve on the
  side for dipping, especially something that you had marinated POULTRY
  in.  A MUCH better idea would be to reserve some of the marinade
  (BEFORE you put the chicken in it) and save it for serving.
      This recipe is also from Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking by Devra
  Dedeaux.  "This recipe is not as hot as you would find in Jamaica.
  For that authentic flavor, double the quantity of dry spices."

      Title: BLACKENED CHICKEN
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
     16    3 oz skinless chicken breast
-SEASONING MIX-
      2 T  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Garlic powder
  1 1/2 t  Ground black pepper
      1 t  White pepper
      1 t  Onion powder
      1 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Gound cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Sweet paprika
----OTHER INGREDIENTS----
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter
  NOTE: Recipe calls for 16 (3-ounce) skinless boned
  chicken breasts, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, or 8
  (10-ounce) bone-in leg-thigh pieces, or a combination
  of these.  Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then bone each
  piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat
  in one piece.  Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast
  or leg-thigh fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken
  come to room temperature before blackening.
   Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
  small bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over
  very high heat until it is extremely hot and just
  short of the point at which you see white ash or a
  white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8
  minutes.  (the time will vary according to the
  intensity of the heat source.)    Heat the serving
  plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  piece of chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that
  both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each fillet
  evenly with the seasoning mix, using about a rounded
  1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with your
  hands.  (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other
  surface to season it, be sure the surface is warm so
  the butter won't congeal and stick to the surface
  instead of to the meat.  Wipe the surface clean after
  seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning
  mix in another recipe.)
     Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in
  the hot skillet, making sure all meat folds are opened
  up and the meat is lying flat.  Pour about 1 teaspoon
  butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as the
  butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet
  at a time, place each fillet in the skillet before
  buttering and seasoning another one.    Cook uncovered
  over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes.  (The time will vary according
  to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the
  skillet or fire;  watch the meat and you'll see a
  white line coming up the side as it cooks.)  Turn the
  fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon more melted
  butter on top of each.  Cook just until meat is cooked
  through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken
  fillets crustier side up while piping hot.    Clean
  the skillet after cooking each batch and repeat the
  blackening procedure with the remaining chicken
  fillets.    To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1
  leg-thigh fillet on each heated serving plate.  If you
  use a large serving platter, do not stack the fillets.
  Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done
  either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The
  process creates an incredible amount of smoke that
  will set off your own and your neighbors' smoke
  alarms.  People with really well-installed commercial
  hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in
  their own kitchens.  They are privileged!  Don't push
  your luck."

           Salad oil for deep frying
  Preparation: Skin, bone and cut the chicken breast into julienne strips.
  Rice: In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, combine rice and water over
  high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and cook 10
  minutes. Drop heat to low and cook for an additional 30 minutes without
  removing the lid. The crusty rice around the sides and bottom will stick to
  the pan. This will be used in the soup. Take off the top layer of softer
  rice and reserve for another use. Lift out the crusty rice and place on a
  cookie sheet to dry at room temperature, or place in a glass baking dish in
  a microwave oven for 10 minutes on low. If the rice is dried at room
  temperature, allow 12-24 hours before deep frying.
  Soup: Toss the strips of chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the
  cornstarch. Set aside. In a small container, combine remaining 2
  tablespoons of cornstarch with water and soy sauce. Heat stock just to
  boiling. Stir in soy mixture and chicken. Simmer 5 minutes. Add the
  shredded greens, onions and sesame oil, if desired. Keep the soup hot (but
  not boiling) while frying rice. Heat oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer or
  heavy saucepan. Fry rice 3 to 5 minutes until puffed and lightly browned.
  Be watchful, because it can burn quickly. Lift rice out of the fat with a
  slotted spoon. Drain the rice on paper towls and place in a heated tureen
  or individual bowls. Pour in the soup. Serve at once. Additional fried rice
  may be passed during the course.

CRISPY EGG LACE
           Oil for deep-frying
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 ts Salt
  COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a fork
  and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press
  it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep
  saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper
  bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the
  oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds.
  Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat
  with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it
  at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are
  done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil
  over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1
  minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and
  set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to
  the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add
  tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a
  dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the
  wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3
  to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the
  reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer
  together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture,
  green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through.
  Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently
  crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of
  noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat.
  Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace
  (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.
  CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep
  oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a
  medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let
  eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until
  lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular
  lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break
  into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. ---

  * Matza meal and Matzots may purchase in some supermarkets and Jewish
  grocery stores.
  (The word Hammin (or Hammim) is derived from the Hebrew adjective Ham or
  warm which describes certain dishes that are kept warm for prolonged
  periods of time...In Pitigliano, however Hammin was the classic one-course
  meal for Passover that both rich and poor used to make. The only difference
  between the versions was the in the cuts of meat used. Poor people used
  breast of lamb..and meatballs made with beef(when the cost of ground beef
  was a fraction of the cost of chicken.) People who didn't have to worry
  about the cost used tiny rib chops from baby lamb and chicken balls."
  Combine ground chicken, 1 Tbsp olive oil, egg, matza meal and 2 Tbsp broth
  in small bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix well. In large
  pot, place the lamb with remaining oil, sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and 1/4
  tsp pepper and lightly brown for 2-3 minutes. Add garlic, parsley and 1 cup
  of warm water. Form many tiny bowls with the ground chicken mixture and
  gently add to pot with lamb. Cover and simmer 1 to 1/2 hours. Add spinach
  and 1 Tsp salt and simmer, covered, 15 minutes longer. Transfer the lamb
  chops, half the spinach and most of the gravy to a hot serving dish and
  keep warm. Add remaining broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add matza pieces
  and cook 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and let stand 5 minutes before
  serving as a soup. Serve the lamb and spinach as the main dish. SERVES: 6-8

      8    Eggs, small;hard boiled
  Passover Chicken Soup with Rice      *matza meal is available at some
  supermarkets and Jewish grocery stores
  "I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the first
  two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our classic soup was a
  chicken soup with rice to which were added balls of chicken breast and
  whole immature eggs (which are still at the stage where the outer shell and
  white have not yet formed; they are perfectly round and vary from less than
  1" to less than 1 mm in diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with
  the white rice, the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens
  raised on private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
  eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.
  Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten egg
  with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add ground chicken,
  salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in the refrigerator for
  at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny balls, no larger than the
  egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add rice, chicken balls and cook,
  covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs, discard whites and place one hard
  boiled egg yolk in each of the eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg
  yolks and serve immediately.

      1 c  Rice; cooked

           Soy sauce; to taste
    Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and 2
  tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while preparing the
  remaining vegetables.
    Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the onions
  until they are limp.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they give up their
  juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve.
    Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to drain
  most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and slightly
  browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3 minutes. Add the
  rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the chicken stock to keep the
  rice from sticking.
    Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the almonds
  and serve immediately.
    Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I very
  often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With cooked
  vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and add them just
  early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not to use vegetables
  that will become mushy with the heating, you will want them to still be
  tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli, even spinach. If you are
  having Denise Bradshaw over to dinner, throw in a few peas.

      1 bn Coriander (cilantro)
      2 tb Best quality olive oil
      1 ts Lemon juice
  Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.  Lay
  each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with the palm
  of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the sides of the
  paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible, and roll up to
  make a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with foil to make a
  waterproof package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.  Measure the olive oil
  into a small saucepan and add a seasoning of salt and pepper.  Coarsely
  chop a tablespoon or two of coriander leaves (a little less for beginners,
  a little more for addicts) and reserve separately.  All these preparations
  can be done well ahead.
      About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
  Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into a
  large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending on the
  size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the surface of the
  liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels, still wrapped up,
  to a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.
      Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.  Warm
  the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2 tablespoons of the
  juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly carve the breasts into
  thin slices and arrange the meat beside the carrots.  Add the lemon juice
  to the hot olive oil and immediately pour the sizzling mixture over the
  chicken and carrots.  Scatter with chopped coriander and serve straightway
  with hot crusty bread to mop up the juices.

      Yield: 12 servings
     12 ea Chicken breasts, boneless

      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
      3 ea Zucchini, grated and drained
      1 ts Tarragon, dried
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/4 c  Parsley, finely chopped
           Salt
           Pepper, fresh ground
SAUCE
    1/2 c  Port
      1 c  Red wine
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Cranberries, dried
      2 c  Chicken stock
  To buy boneless chicken breasts with the skin on, purchase chicken breasts
  on the bone and ask your butcher or supermarket to remove the bones but
  leave the skin intact. It is a much more beautiful presentation and it
  keeps the chicken moist. Bones can be used to make stock or discarded. If
  you prefer, or can only obtain skinless chicken, then make a cut on the
  bottom of each breast the length of the breast to form a pocket. Stuff each
  breast with same amount of filling and turn slit side down. Brush top with
  a film of Dijon mustard and continue with recipe. To heighten mushroom
  flavour, add one 10g package of soaked dried mushrooms along with the
  regular mushrooms, if desired. Dried currents may be substituted for
  cranberries. Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Heat butter in skillet on
  medium high heat. Add onion, saute until softened the add mushrooms and
  zucchini. Saute until all liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally,
  about 10 minutes. Stir in tarragon and cream. Continue to cook until cream
  has reduced and mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and
  add enough breadcrumbs to hold mixture together. Add parsely and season
  well with salt and pepper. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
  With fingertips, make a pocket between skin and flesh of each chicken
  breast. Stuff about 1/3 c filling under skin, tucking skin around breast to
  enclose stuffing. Place chicken breasts in large oiled (preferably metal)
  baking dish or roasting pan. Dot with butter, refrigerate until one hour
  before baking. Baking in 400F (200C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until
  juices run clear. If skin is not quite crisp enough, place under broiler to
  crisp it. While chicken is baking, place sauce ingredients in pot and bring
  to boil over medium high heat. Reduce by half, skimming occasionally, about
  25 minutes. Over low heat, whisk in butter, 1 tb at a time, until sauce is
  slightly thickened and glossy. Just before serving, skim any fat off pan
  juices and add juices to sauce. Either slice chicken breasts into 1/4 inch
  slices before serving and coat with sauce or serve chicken breasts whole
  and place sauce in sauce boat. Garnish with extra dried cranberries, if
  desired.

      Title: PEANUT STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
 Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 servings
     12    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/8 c  Honey
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Mint, dried
      1 pk G. Washington's Golden
           -bouillon mix
  Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as
  possible. (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any
  knifework I've tried to date.)  Pull off shreds and gobbets.
  Put peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.
  Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to
  mix.
  Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over each
  piece of breast meat.  Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on the
  breast and roll them up into a packet.  Tie the packet shut with
  butcher's twine or fasten with a toothpick.
  Arrange the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful
  not to let any fall open.
  Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and mix
  well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets.
  Add water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch.
  Turn crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours.
  Remove packets from pot and let drain on a platter.

      Title: * CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Poultry, Breakfast, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
      3 lb Chicken breasts, split in
           - Half and boned
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
           Garlic powder to taste
      1 lb Smoked sausage or kielbasa
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Chopped onion (1 lg)
      1 c  Chopped pepper (1 lg)
      1 c  Chopped celery (2 ribs)
      7 c  Water divided
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Chopped garlic (1 clove)
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    Season chicken breasts lightly with salt, black pepper and garlic powder.
  If possible, do this the day before you cook the gumbo.  Next slice sausage
  into 1/4-to-1/2 inch pieces.
    Make roux, using a cast iron or very heavy skillet that is very clean.
  Place oil in skillet over high heat - oil should be at stage where it just
  begins to smoke - and gradually stir in flour, using a long-handled spoon.
    Roux will take about 3 to 4 minutes to cook and must be stirred
  constantly so that it does not burn.  If you see black specks in the roux,
  it has burned and you must start over again.
    As you make the roux, it will change in color from cream to tan to brown
  and then to dark red-brown.  Remove from heat.  Stir in onions, green
  peppers and celery, stirring constantly until roux stops getting darker.
  Bring to stove once more, and cook over low heat about five to seven
  minutes, stirring constantly.
    In a large dutch oven, bring 6 c of water to a boil, and add the roux,
  stirring to dissolve it thoroughly.  Carefully add chicken and cook about
  30 to 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Remove chicken, and
  set aside to cool.  Debone chicken, and cut into bite-size pieces.
    Add sausage, 1 c water, 1 ts black pepper and chopped garlic and cayenne
  to the pot, and simmer for 35 to 45 minutes, uncovered, stirring
  frequently.  Taste, and add salt, if necessary.  Stir in the chicken, and
  remove the gumbo from the heat.  skim surface to remove fat that sausage
  gives off during cooking.
    Serve over rice with a tossed salad and French bread.
    Note: Excellent.

      Title: CHINESE: CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPICY
 Categories: Main dish, Nuts, Chinese, Ethnic, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
    1/2 c  Raw peanuts
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Whole chicken breasts at
           -room temp.
      1 lg Egg white
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
           SAUCE:
      4    Green onions
      2 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil
    1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 ts (level) chili paste with
           -garlic
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 pn Sugar
  cornstarch paste
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white part
  into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan.
  Reserve.
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat into
  1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold
  chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single
  chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk). Stir chicken pieces into egg
  mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut flour
  gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be
  substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll
  need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a light tan
  color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts with
  strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they are
  frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green onions &
  peanuts about a minute before serving. At the last minute, add chicken
  pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

  an insurance company.  Published in Chicago Tribune Magaine 11/14/93.
  [Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see that
  nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices -- other
  than the chili powder (which was not listed in the "ingredients,"
  originally -- I had to go back and insert that)  or what to do with the
  vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices in the cooking oil and
  smear it over the chicken breast before grilling or broiling. Suggestions,
  of course, will be appreciated.  Complaints will be ignored.]

      Title: AL'S CHICKEN SCHNITZEL
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 3 servings
      1 kg Chicken Breasts
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Flour
      2 c  Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)
  All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and Australian
  currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in half as
  described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs about $10 to
  serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed potato and mini
  carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first Recipe so here goes.
  Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet to beat
  chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim any skin or get
  skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories.
  Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second
  plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread crumbs
  on it.
  Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg either
  by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs and put on
  plate.
  On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so that
  the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is very
  soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the cooking for the
  family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or what but they taste
  best that way.Just cook them and when the look cooked cut in half and if
  the meat is white(like chicken sould look not the colour of an uncooked
  fillet) they are cooked.I cook on medium heat in a frypan with some oil.
  Serving Suggestions: In the Colder months this meal is best served with
  Mashed potato and gravy as well as carrots and any other vegetables you
  like.
  In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the
  lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin pineapple
  ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a filling and
  tasty meal.
  Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated. CYA!

 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
      6    Chicken breast halves,
           -boneless
      2 T  Dark soy sauce
      2 T  Salad oil
      2 T  Honey
      2 T  Fresh, strained lime juice
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Cayenne pepper
--MANGO SALSA--
      2    Mangos (about 1 lb. each) **
    1/2 c  Finely diced red onion
    1/2 c  Cucumbers - see instructions
      2    Peppers, seeded and diced
           Juice of two limes
    1/2 t  Salt
--BASIC-CAPER MAYONNAISE--
      2    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 T  Strained fresh lime juice
    1/4 t  SALT, HEAPING
  Cucumbers should be finely dice, unpeeled.-
  Trim the chicken breast halves of all fat and gristle and separate the
  tenderloin.  Mix soy, oil, honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a
  shallow dish just large enough to hold the chicken in one close layer.
  Marinate the chicken in this mixture for 1 hour at room temperature or for
  several hours the refrigerator, turning several times.  Grill the chicken
  breasts for 3 to 4 minutes per side, the tenderloins about 2 minutes per
  side.  The chicken may also be sauteed over moderate heat in a skillet
  lightly filmed with oil.  The bottom of the skillet will darken as the
  honey caramelizes but is easily cleaned.
  Cut the breasts in thick slices and fan on dinner plates, placing the
  tenderloins along side.  Spoon the salsa over the top and drizzle with the
  mayonnaise.
  MANGO SALSA
  Slice the mango flesh from each side of the pit.  One half at a time, make
  an inch cut just inside the skin, then score the flesh in 3/8-inch cubes.
  Turn skin inside out and free the mango flesh with the knife. Cut the cubes
  in inch dice, reserving any mushy pieces for some other use. You should end
  up with about 1 1/2 cups. Combine mango with all remaining ingredients and
  let sit 30 minutes to blend flavor.
  **  Note:  1 1/2 Cups peach or papaya dice may be substituted for the
  mango.

      3    Chiles,fresh whole green
    1/2 c  Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Sauterne
     12 oz Beer
  1. In a large non-aluminum (preferably glass or glazed cast iron)
     bowl make a marinade by combining the burgundy, thyme, bay leaves,
     garlic, and black pepper. Place all the beef in the bowl and mix
     lightly to coat the meat well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
     (If time is short marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.)
  2. Place the chicken breasts in a saucepan with enough water to
     cover. Add 1 teaspoon salt and simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour.
     Remove the chicken reserving the liquid. Chop the chicken breasts
     fine and reserve.
  3. Meal the oil in a large heavy pot. Add the onions and cook until
     they are translucent.
  4. Meanwhile, drain the beef, straining and reserving the marinade.
     Mix the beef and pork together, then combine the meats with the
     ground chile, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, rosemary, and the
     rest of the salt.  Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with
     the onions. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring
     occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned.
  5. Add half the marinade, the reserved chicken, tomatoes, both tomato
     sauces, jalapenos, and 1 tablespoon of liquid hot pepper sauce to
     the pot.
  6. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the fresh
     chiles, mushrooms, and a small amount of the Sauterne and cook for
     3 minutes. Add this to the pot.
  7. Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for at least 3 hours. When
     the chili is cooking, from time to time stir in the remaining
     marinade, the remaining Sauterne, and beer. If more liquid is
     needed, stir in the water the chicken was cooked in. Taste and
     adjust seasonings.

 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
      2 c  Coconut milk
      6    Thin slices young galangal
      2    Stalks lemon grass,
           ; lower third portion only,
           ; cut into 1" piece, crushed
      5    Fresh kaffir lime leaves
      8 oz Boned chicken breast, sliced
      5 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Lime juice
      1 ts Black chili paste
    1/4 c  Cilantro/coriander leaves
           ; torn
      5    Green Thai chili peppers,
           ; crushed
  A rich, aromatic dinner soup, which is enjoyed throughout the meal.
  Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their
  flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a
  knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink shoots.
  Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the flavor will not
  be quite the same.
  Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime
  leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling.  Add the chicken, fish
  sauce and sugar.
  Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked .  Add the
  remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.
  Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the soup
  into the serving bowl.
  Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and serve.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place
  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and
  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole
  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the
  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to
  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and
  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.
  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for
  garnish.
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper
  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,
  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds. We also served it
  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who
  cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any
  tender, delicate white fish ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or
  maybe little chunks of monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as
  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I
  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,
  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available
  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or
  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok
  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild. I like it
  in the middle.
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,
  I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the
  slices of lemon grass and ginger.

      Title: SMOKED CHICKEN AND PEPPERONI GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Chicken
      Yield: 6 servings
           -Spice mixture:
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Dry parsley flakes
    1/2 ts Gumbo file powder
           -(optional)
           -Vegetables:
      2 c  Onion
      2 c  Green pepper
      2 c  Celery
           -meats:
      2    Smoked chicken breasts.
     12    Inches pepperoni.
           -broth:
      6 c  Chicken broth
  Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut rest in
  fine chop (or use food processor).
  Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and pulled
  into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked chicken, you may
  get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke. I would guess no more
  than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches) pepperoni, cut into
  moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about twice as thick as presliced
  pizza pepperoni usually is)
  Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and
  singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,
  stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for about
  5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add spice mixture
  and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry roux. Add the broth
  and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to medium low and simmer for at
  least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender and flavors are merged. About
  5 minutes before serving, add the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture.
  At the same time, add more roux to thicken if desired.
  Serve in bowl over lots of rice.
  For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese
  cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni. Remove
  all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken pieces.
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

  it is very hot. Remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon.
  Add it to the pan and stir-fry it for 2 minutes until it browns. Remove it
  and leave to drain in a colander or sieve. Pour off most of the oil,
  leaving about 2 teaspoons. Reheat the pan over a high heat and then add the
  dried chiles. Stir-fry them for 10 seconds, and then return the chicken to
  the pan. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir-fry for 4 minutes, mixing

      Yield: 6 servings
-JUDI M. PHELPS-
      1 lb Boneless, chicken breasts;
           -skinless and trimmed of all
           -fat
    1/2 ts Salt; optional
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 ts Tub-style margarine; canola
           -or corn oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1 cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth; defatted and
           -divided
      2 T  Mild honey
      2 T  Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt; or to taste optional
  1 1/2 c  Cauliflower florets
      1 lg Carrot; peeled and thinly
           -sliced
    1/4 c  ;water
      1 T  Cornstarch
      2 T  Dijon-style mustard
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain white rice
           -uncooked
  Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt,
  if desired, and pepper.  In large nonstick, spray- coated skillet, cook
  chicken pieces over medium heat, turning frequently with large wooden or
  plastic spoon, 7-10 minutes or until they begin to brown and are cooked
  through.  Remove and set aside in medium bowl. In same skillet, combine
  margarine, onion, garlic, and 3 tablespoons broth. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring frequently, 6-7 minutes or until onion is tender. If liquid begins
  to evaporate, add a bit more broth. Add honey and lemon juice to pan with
  onions, and stir to combine well. Stir in remaining chicken broth and salt,
  if desired.  Stir in reserved chicken, cauliflower, and carrot. Bring to a
  boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until flavors are
  blended.  Meanwhile, cook rice according to package directions.
  Combine water and cornstarch.  Stir into simmering sauce and cook,
  stirring, until thickened.  Stir in mustard.  Simmer an additional 1 or 2
  minutes.  Arrange rice on large serving platter.  Top with chicken and
  sauce.  Or serve individual portions over rice.
  Judi's Notes:  I have not tried this dish but cooking cauliflower for 20
  minutes is just too long.  I would advise 10 minutes tops to keep it's
  bright color and not become mushy.

      2 T  Chopped scallions
    1/2 lb Button mushrooms, whole
           -or quartered large ones
           -wiped, stems removed
           Salt
           Freshly ground white

      1 ds Lemon juice
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1    Beurre Manie*
      2 T  Finely chopped chives
  * Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  These butter-flour balls can be
  made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the refrigerator for 1
  or 2 weeks.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a small flat plate
  and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth paste. Roll the paste
  into a ball. In a small skillet, heat 2 T of butter. Add the scallions and
  cook for 2 or 3 minutes without browning.  Add the mushrooms. Season with
  salt and pepper and cook the mixture over high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes
  to brown the mushrooms lightly. Reserve. Season the chicken breasts with
  salt and pepper and sprinkle them with lemon juice. In a large chicken
  fryer, melt the remaining butter. When it is quite hot, add the chicken
  breasts and cook them for 1 minute on each side.  Cover the pan with
  buttered wax paper and then the pan lid.  Lower the heat and simmer the
  chicken breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the juices run out
  pale yellow when pierced with a fork. Do not overcook or pierce every
  piece.  Immediately remove the chicken breasts to a serving platter. Pour
  the chicken stock into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the stock until
  it is almost a glaze. Add the heavy cream and continue cooking over high
  heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the sauce heavily coats a spoon.
  Add the chives and correct the seasoning. Add the mushroom & scallion
  mixture.  Add the chives and correct the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the
  chicken breasts and serve at once. From "Season Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

  into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan.
  Reserve.
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones.  Slice meat into
  1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold
  chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single
  chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg
  mixture to coat thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut
  flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be
  substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll
  need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a light tan
  color;
  if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts with
  strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first:  chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time.  Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they
  are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon.  Reserve.
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions
  & peanuts about a minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken
  pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

  Midnight supper, perhaps for New Year's Eve or after the show, can be
  exotic in a hurry. The foods are sliced ahead, the sauces made, then all
  stowed in the refrigerator. When guests are hungry, the hostess simply
  heats the broth and sets out the makings.
  Genghis Khan hot pot is another name for this Chinese specialty. Or maybe
  you've seen it on restaurant menus as volcano soup. We show an
  honest-to-goodness Mongolian cooker with a charcoal chimney in the center,
  but any chafing dish or electric skillet will do as well.
  What's cooking. Everything on the tray is raw, of course--chunks of
  eggplant, crosscut strips of sirloin, halved mushrooms, thin slices of
  chicken breast, squares of Chinese cabbage, shucked shrimp. Fresh spinach
  to simmer along with the other foods is ready in the big red bowl. The
  broth is chicken bouillon that boasts a faint overtone of ginger.
  Individual bowls of fluffy rice are served at the same time as Hot Pot.
  The how-to. You pick out a few choice tidbits at a time and drop them from
  chopsticks, bamboo tongs, or fork into the lazily bubbling broth. In a few
  minutes, fish them out to dip into zesty sauces on your plate, like Peanut
  or Red Sauce, Chinese Mustard or Ginger Soy.
  Traditionalists poach eggs in the broth when it has taken on subtle flavor
  from the foods that have simmered in it. At the very last, the hostess may
  ladle the broth as a soup. It's delicious! Dessert? Skip it, or serve a
  fruit bowl and candied ginger with coffee or tea.
  Etiquette: Use one set of chopsticks for cooking and fishing out morsels
  from Hot Pot, use a second set for eating. If only one set is provided for
  each guest, simply reverse your chopsticks (large ends down) when you cook
  or help yourself to food.
  Oriental Hot Pot
  Chinese Mustard Ginger Soy Peanut Sauce Red Sauce Hot cooked rice
  Shortly before cooking time arrange the meats and vegetables on large tray
  or platter; use a bowl for spinach. Set out dunking sauces. Provide Bamboo
  tongs, chopsticks or long-handled forks as cooking tools for guests.
  Heat chicken broth in electric skillet or chafing dish (or use Mongolian
  cooker-- directions follow). Add bouillon cubes to hot broth and stir to
  dissolve; add monosodium glutamate and ginger. Heat to simmering. For
  cooking have broth barely bubbling. Each Guest picks up desired foods with
  chopsticks or whatever, drops them into the bubbling broth. When his
  tidbits are cooked, he lifts them out and dips into the sauces on his
  plate. Serve with rice. Makes 4 servings.
  To use Mongolian cooker, fill chimney of cooker with charcoal and add
  charcoal starter. Pour cold chicken broth into cooker. Cover cooker, then
  light charcoal. When broth is hot, continue as above.

  Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
  sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and green
  peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook until veggies
  are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not browned. Remove from pan
  and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute mushrooms until browned, remove
  and add to rest of the stuff. Last step, saute the chicken until done. Add
  everything else back into the pan, season generously with rosemary and
  oregano. Throwing a little basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems
  dry, add small amounts of either plain chicken broth or a broth & white
  wine mix. If you've added too much liquid, then thicken it with cornstarch.

  Thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  (If doing veggie version, cut
  vegetables into thin strips.) Grind together red chili peppers, lemon
  grass, and kaffir lime leaves in a food processor or pound in a mortar.
  Heat oil to medium-high and saute pepper mixture for 3 minutes.  Stir in
  coconut milk and cook for 2 minutes.  Add chicken (or vegetables) and cook
  for 5 minutes or until cooked (same time for veggies).  Reduce heat to
  medium-low.  Stir in fish sauce (if using), salt, and basil.  Serve on a

  Note: ===== For mixed vegetables, choose from among bell peppers, string
  beans, water chestnuts, tomatoes (small cherry tomatoes are best), bamboo
  shoots, miniature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini, Japanese eggplant,
  and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans or asparagus, a few cherry
  tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced) bamboo shoots, miniature corn, and
  some straw mushrooms or slender (Japanese) eggplant.

  them into the mixture; stir in the remaining noodles and half the bean
  sprouts.  Cook just until the bean sprouts are nearly wilted.
  Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter.  Cover one half of them with
  ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts.  Ring the
  noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and garnish the
  top with the fried basil.
