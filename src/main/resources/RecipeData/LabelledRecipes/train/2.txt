Add the onions,   celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and   seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6   minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in   the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring   occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room   temperature.   Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add   the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the   bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the   pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6   inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes,   then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes   longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.   This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives   more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.   From Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.     In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork.  Mix     in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed.  Set     aside.    In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter,     the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco and     meat seasoning mix.  Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring     frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and     cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to     the meat and mix well by hand.  Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and center     in the pan.  Bake at 450F until brown on top, about 30 minutes.     Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons.  Set     meat and drippings aside.    Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork     tender; drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water.  Place the     potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1     stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white pepper.  Stir with a     wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or     electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.  (NOTE:     Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy     enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the     reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning     mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the     zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing until vegetables are     noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring     occasionally.  Remove from heat.    Mound undrained vegetables on top     of the meat loaf, away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes     evenly over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the meat, using     all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10     minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce     (see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana     Kitchen"  
3    Zucchini, Medium Size.   1 1/2 c  Lean Ground Pork or Chicken.       2    Eggs, lightly beaten.       2 T  Fish Sauce.            Ground White Peppers.       2 T  Cilantro, chopped.       6 c  Chicken or Pork Stock.     Peel zucchini and cut into approximately 1-1/2" lengths.  Make the lengths   of zucchini into cups by scooping out the seeds in the center, but leaving   small amount to form the bottom of the cup.  You may need more or less   zucchini than the amount given, depending on their size.   In a bowl, mix the ground pork or chicken with fish sauce, eggs, ground   white peppers, and cilantro.  Fill the zucchini cups with the mixture, and   overfill slightly to make a small mound.  Cook the filled zucchini cups by   steaming for about 1/2 hour.   Bring the chicken or pork stock to a boil, and season to taste.  Place the   precooked zucchini cups into a serving tureen, pour the boiling stock   over them, and serve.

Wheat Starch Wrappers (see recipe) Vegetable oil Light soy sauce, for   dipping Chinese mustard, for dipping      Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and pliable.   Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off the stems   at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.      Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well with   cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.      Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium- high   heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water   chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.   Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the   cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour   into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow   plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling   to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.      Makes almost 2 cups of filling.      Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of dough.   Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle. An oiled   Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press or a   rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of the   circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling inside.   Repeat with remaining dough and filling.      Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo   steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3   minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve   with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.      Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.      Posted by Stephen Ceideburg. Reposted by Fred Peters.

PASTRY DOUGH:  Sift flour, salt, and baking powder in a 1-quart bowl.  Mix   well.  Cut in shortening.  Mix milk and beaten eggs and add to flour   mixture.  Divide dough into 10 portions.  Place one portion on a floured   board and roll into a circle approximately 7 inches in diameter.  Use a   lid or saucer to cut into a circle about 6 inches in diameter.  Place   several tablespoonsful of the meat mixture on one edge of the pastry.   Fold dough over.  Dampen edges with water.  Crimp edges together with a   fork.  (Make other pies in same manner.)  Preheat oil to 350 degrees F. in   a deep fat electric fryer.  Place pies in oil and fry until golden brown.   Remove from oil and drain on absorbent paper paper.  
3 lb Ground beef       1 lb Ground pork     1/4 lb Kidney fat, chopped fine       1 c  Bread crumbs, day old       1    Onion, chopped fine       2    Egg yolks     1/4 lb Salt pork, chopped       3 tb Butter       1 tb Flour     1/2 ts Savory     1/2 c  Cream            Salt and pepper     Fry onion in butter until transparent, not yellow. Combine the meat,   kidney fat, salt pork, bread crumbs, onion, egg yolks, and seasonings   and mix very thoroughly with your hand. Shape into a loaf, rub with   butter and bake at 350F for one hour. Baste often. In the last 15   minutes, sprinkle flour on meat and add cream.  
5    Cloves garlic, peeled     1/4 c  Water       1 lb Ground chuck     2/3 lb Coarsely ground pork       1 ts Baking soda   1 1/2 ts Salt       1 ts Black pepper     1/2 ts Dried thyme, whole     1/2 ts Dried basil     1/2 c  Beef stock     Crush the garlic well in the water, using a fork. Stir the meat,   baking soda, seasonings, and garlic puree together. Add Beef Stock   and mix well. For each sausage, take 1/3 cup of the meat mixture, and   roll between the palms of your hands into a sausage shape about 4   inches long. Place sausages side by side in a container and cover.   Refrigerate overnight so that the flavors can blend.   These are excellent on the grill. They may also be broiled or baked   in the oven. Broil the sausages about 3 minutes per side until cooked   through and browned..   HINT: When hand rolling sausages or meatballs of any kind, keep a   small bowl of water near you so that you can keep your hands a bit   wet. This way the meat will not stick to your hands.

12 lg Squids     1/2 lb Ground pork       3    Green onions, finely sliced       1    Egg, beaten            Salt and pepper to taste       1    Garlic clove, minced       1 tb Vegetable oil       1 md Onion, chopped       1 md Tomato, chopped     1/2    Bay leaf       1 tb Soy sauce     Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and inside.   Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside.   In a large bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a little   salt and pepper.   Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and slippery, don't   over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell when cooking. A pastry   bag makes this easier to do.   Place a pan in a steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15 minutes,   or until filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside.   Prepare sauce while steaming calamari.  In a skillet over medium heat,   saute garlic in oil until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1 minute.   Add tomato, bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomato   pieces are soft.   Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari.  Serve with rice.   Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir fry   them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from steaming the   calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good dish to serve to   people who don't like calamari or are a bit squeamish.   Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm and green.

Put mixture in the freezer awhile to   cool. Warm meat tends to soften the wrappers and make things messy.   Heat vegetable oil in fryer to 325 degrees.   To roll, place about 3 tb filling mixture in the center of the wrapper.   Fold 1 corner over mixture and fold in ends. Continue rolling. Brush egg   mixture on exposed corner of wrapper to help seal egg roll.   Put egg rolls in hot oil, a few at a time, and fry a few minutes on each   side until golden brown. Remove to drain on paper towels. Serve warm with   soy sauce, hot mustard, or sauce of your choice. Makes 18 egg rolls.

Moisten your   fingers with cold water and spread the filling mixture evenly over the   surface of the pancake, then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll.   Seal with a little leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls   on a flat plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an   inch of simmering water for 15 minutes.

Remove from heat and pour in 1 1/2 cup flour and beat until   it forms a ball.  Divide into 1 1/4 inch balls and roll each until paper   thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and seal. Arrange in   steamer and steam 30 minutes.           Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker wrappers   (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1 inch thick) and   the filling can be just about anything.  I have done these with leftover   meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms, celery etc.      Courtesy of Ted Taylor. Reposted by Fred Peters.

The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a   unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors.  Roll out the   wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.           Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and   pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms.  Cut off   the stems at the base and discard them.  Finely mince the caps.           Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes.  Rinse well   with cold water, pat dry thoroughly.  Coarsely mince.           Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-   high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water   chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.   Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce.  Combine the   cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour   into wok.  Stir fry for 1 minute longer.  Remove the mixture to a shallow   plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander.  Allow the   filling to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.      Makes almost 2 cups of filling.           Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of   dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.   An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press   or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of   the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling   inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.           Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo   steamer (or a heat resistant plate).  Steam over boiling water for 3   minutes.  Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve   with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.      Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.      Posted by Stephen Ceideburg. Reposted by Fred Peters.

Arrange whole hard-boiled eggs in a row along the middle of the   meat.  Fold sides of meat pattie over the eggs. Shape meat carefully into a   loaf resembling a flat bread loaf. Occasionally rinse hands in cold water   to prevent sticking.  Cube 2 strips bacon; cook in a Dutch oven about 2   minutes.  Carefully add the vegetable oil; heat. Place meatloaf in the   Dutch oven and cook until browned on all sides. Cut remaining bacon strips   in half and arrange over the top of the meatloaf. Place uncovered Dutch   oven in a preheated oven for about 45 minutes. While meat is baking,   gradually pour hot beef broth over the top of the meatloaf; brush   occasionally with pan drippings. When done remove meat to a preheated   platter and keep it warm. Add 1/4 cup of hot water to pan and scrape all   particles from the bottom.  Bring to a gentle boil and add cornstarch that   has been mixed with 1/4 cup water.  Cook until bubbly and thick. Remove   from heat and stir in sour cream.  Reheat to warm.  Season with salt and   pepper if desired.  Serve the sauce separately.  
1 lb Semolina flour     1/4 c  Olive oil, extra virgin       1    Onion, chopped     1/4 c  Parsley, chopped     1/2 ts Saffron       3 oz Pork fat, chopped       7 oz Ground pork       7 oz Lamb, lean, ground   1 1/2 lb Tomatoes, chopped fine in            -food processor       2    Bay leaves       6    Sage leaves, fresh or            -1/2 tsp dried            Salt and pepper     3/4 c  Aged pecorino cheese            -optional     Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:  1:30 To make   gnocchi, pour flour onto work surface and make a well in the centre. Pour   in the olive oil.  Dissolve saffron in a bit of warm water and add to well.   Mix liquid with flour, adding enough water to form a firm, not sticky,   dough.  You'll have to add the water 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough is   the right consistency.  Cut dough into pieces and roll into long cylinders,   about 1/2 inch diameter.  Cut into 1-inch chunks and press your finger into   each gnocchi to make a deep dent. Set gnocchi aside on a floured surface to   dry while you make the sauce. Heat pork fat in saute pan and cook the onion   and parsley until tender. Stir in the ground meat and cook until no longer   pink.  Add the chopped tomatoes, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Cook,   uncovered, for an hour or until the sauce is thickened. Cook gnocchi in   boiling salted water until cooked al dente.  Drain and arrange in pasta   dishes.  Pour sauce over top and garnish with a handful of grated cheese.   Serves 4-6.

Put in a casserole dish with the lard, the sliced   onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced yellow turnip.  Roast at 390 degrees   F until the onions turn brown.  Then, add a little bit of water. Continue   to roast, basting frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is   getting too dark, cover the top of the meatloaf with aluminum foil.  In the   olden days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the   same effect.      At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may be   served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan juices.      Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].      Serves 4.      [Note:  'Falscher Has' literally means imitation rabbit.

1/2 c  Unseasoned bread crumbs     1/2 c  Half and half cream       4 tb Unsalted butter     1/4 c  Minced white onions     1/3 lb Ground beef     1/3 lb Ground veal     1/3 lb Ground pork       1 lg Egg     1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg     1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)     1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper     1.  Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5 minutes in a large   mixing bowl.      2.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over low to moderate   heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the onions and saute them for   about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly.      3.  Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt, pepper, and onions to the   bread-crumb mixture. Gently combine the ingredients with your hands.      4.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a couple of hours.      5.  Shape the meat mixture with your hands into uniform 2/3-inch balls.   Arrange them on a plate in one layer so they do not touch each other. Let   the meatballs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.      6.  Melt the remaining butter in a saute pan or skillet over moderate heat.   When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs. (Do not crowd the pan;   unless your pan is oversized, you will have to cook gthe meatballs in   batches and keep the cooked ones warm in a preheated 200 degree F oven.)   Saute the meatballs for about 5 minutes until they become brown on all   sides. Turn them as necessary, but do so gently.      7.  Transfer the 'koettbullar' to a warm platter and serve immediately.      Serves 8.      From:  GREAT PEASANT DISHES OF THE WORLD by Howard Hillman ISBN   0-395-32210-3.

The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a   unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll out the   wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.           Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and   pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off   the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.           Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well   with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.           Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-   high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water   chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.   Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the   cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour   into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow   plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling   to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.      Makes almost 2 cups of filling.           Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of   dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.   An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press   or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of   the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling   inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.           Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo   steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3   minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve   with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.      Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.      Posted by Stephen Ceideburg. Reposted by Fred Peters.

Mix   mixture for skin; rub chicken inside & out with it. Leave uncovered at room   temperature, while coating is absorbed and dried. Repeat if necessary.      Stuffing:  In hot wok, heat peanut oil to smoking. Stir-fry ground pork 2   minutes; add mustard green, ginger & sugar; stir-fry 1 more minute. Remove   & cool.      Lotus Leaves:  Number of leaves depends on their size & that of chicken.   Reduce heat under boiling water to simmer, & steep leaves for 3-5 minutes,   until wet through & pliable (no longer or leaves may shred). Now soak in   cold water for 10 minutes, or longer, until time to use them; open folded   leaves in cold water to wash them.      Wrap Chicken:  Preheat oven to 550 degrees.  Stuff chicken with pork   mixture. Cut hard center out of lotus leaves, then slit along fold about 3"   on each side of center, so cut away center can be overlapped. Wrap chicken   in 3 layers of lotus leaves.  Tie securely with piece of cotton or fiber   string (don't use nylon; it might melt). Spread soft, wet modeling clay   about 1/2" thick on sheet of newspaper.  Bring clay pack around chicken &   seal.  Remove newspaper. (Use foil if clay unavailable.)      Roasting:  Place clay-covered chicken on rack in shallow roasting pan in   preheated oven.  Bake for 1 hour; reduce heat to 350 degrees & bake for   another 1 1/2 hours.      Serve:  Present fired clay chicken to table.  Crack clay with suitable   object, allowing some of steam to escape before you proceed. Remove clay;   carefully cut open lotus leaves with scissors. Chicken will be very soft &   tender; break apart to get at stuffing.  Serve guests, or invite them to   pick with chopsticks.

Some versions are extremely sweet and sticky; this version is less so, but   the important flavors are still sweet, sour, and salty in that order. Be   sure to use a large enough pan for saucing the noodles (step 5); a 14-inch   wok is ideal.      1. In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, and   sugar and set aside.      2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Drop approximately   an ounce of rice sticks into the oil; they will puff up and rise to the top   of the oil in only a few seconds. Turn them over once and fry until crisp,   about 15 seconds in all. Transfer finished noodles to a pan lined with   paper towels and continue frying the batter in small batches. Keep noodles   warm in a low oven.      3. Dip a hand in the beaten egg and, holding your hand approximately 8   inches above the hot oil, drizzle egg over the surface in a random pattern.   Continue with about half the egg mixture, forming a lacy network of egg.   Fry until golden brown on underside, turn over once, and brown other side.   Transfer to a plate and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining egg.      4. Heat a second wok over medium high heat and add approximately 2   tablespoons oil from the first wok. Add onion, garlic, and chile and cook   until they are fragrant. Add meats or shrimp and stir-fry just until done.      5. Stir sugar mixture and add to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until   slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low and add about a quarter of the fried   noodles and eggs. Stir together and toss to break up noodle clumps and coat   with sauce. Continue adding noodles and eggs in batches until all are   coated with sauce. Transfer to serving platter and garnish with sliced   green onion.      Serves 4 with other dishes.

This is probably my favorite recipe eventhough this is the one which has   evolved the most in the past 5 years.  A couple of years ago my father   mistakenly calculated the spices in tablespoons instead of teaspoons, and   it   was better then the previous batch of sausage written above.  The next   year we   increased the amount of black pepper, and was it ever good.  So if you like   spices, and in sausage a little spice is good, then play around with the   mixture a little bit.  I will be adding a small amount of a "cajun" pepper   mix   to a small 20 lb. test batch of sausage this weekend.

These triangular little goodies are   great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!   Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.      Set aside.      Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.   Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.      Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and   dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with   only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a   barely damp cloth to prevent curling.      Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread   flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it   out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become   pliable within seconds.      Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the   filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in   the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.   Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press   into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it   is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely   and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold   the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed   roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers   in the same manner.      Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2   inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.   Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will   stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning   often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.   Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.      Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and   coriander leaves.      NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F   oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.

The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first   one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.   Set aside.      Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water   until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the   mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.   Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a   large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.      Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and   dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must   be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for   handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep   golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with   only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets   covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,   immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat   on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice   paper will become pliable within seconds.      Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of   filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a   compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then   the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the   filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.      Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2   inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in   batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or   let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat   for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove   the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low   oven while frying the remaining rolls.      Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in   this recipe.      To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few   strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the   Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as   an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a   main course.      NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the   noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the   individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground   roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.

I have recipes for won ton dough   too, if you want them.

Mince fine.  Stem mushrooms and mince caps.   Mix with prawns, pork, water chestnuts, green onions, half of the   beaten eggs and all of the seasonings.      WRAPPING:      Place won ton squares on working surface so corners face up, down,   left and right.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each skin.      Dip a little of the beaten egg onto the bottom corner, bring top   corner to meet bottom corner.  Press to seal.  Moisten left corner   and bring right corner to meet it.  Press to seal.  [This should give   you a little bundle that looks kinda like a nurses hat.  S.C.]      FRYING:      Heat 4 cups oil in wok.  Fry wrapped won ton until golden (about 2   minutes).  Turn over once.  Drain and serve hot.      DO-AHEAD NOTES:      Deep fry won ton, cool and freeze.  To reheat, preheat oven to 350F.      Place frozen won ton onto cookie sheets and heat for 12 to 15 minutes.      COMMENTS:      You may substitute ground turkey for meat in won ton filling.      However since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add a few more   water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to enhance flavor   and texture.      From "The Chinese Village Cookbook."

It's a bit more complex, but one of   the ingredients might be a bit hard to find++tuong, a kind of soy   bean paste used in Vietnam.  A good Vietnamese market will have it.   Using medium heat, fry the garlic in the oil.  Add the liver and   pork. Lower the heat and add the tomato paste; stir and add the   tuong. Stir again and add the water and peanut butter.  Raise the   heat to medium and add the sugar. Boil for 1 minute and transfer to a   bowl.      Add the sesame seeds to a medium-hot frying pan, stirring constantly   until browned.  This should take 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sesame   seeds to the nuoc leo, along with the chopped peanuts.      The sauce can be garnished with thin strips of hot pepper.      NOTE:  Beef or chicken liver can be substituted, but pork liver is   preferred.  The piece should be the size of a large chicken liver.

The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when   you're faced with yet another turkey to fix.  One is from the US, the   rest are from other parts of the world.  The Argentine Creole   Stuffing looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to   stuff and cook a turkey.      Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds   richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts   this stuffing out of the ordinary.      Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,   pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients   and mix well.

The green beans exude aromatic   flavors and have an interesting chewy texture.  I do not fry the   beans as long as traditional recipes call for because I want them to   have some texture left.      Cover the dried shrimp with hot water for 30 minutes.  Drain.  Chop   into the consistency of coarse bread crumbs.      Rinse the Sichuan preserved vegetables with cold water to wash off the   brine and salt; chop into the same texture as the shrimp. In a hot   wok add the oil and heat to 375F.      Deep fry the beans in two or three batches for 2 to 3 minutes or   until they look wrinkled, blistered and khaki color.      Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the oil from the wok.  Reheat the wok   over high heat.      Add the ginger and garlic; stir-fry for 15 seconds.  Add the pork,   preserved mustard, dried shrimp; stir-fry for 1 minute longer. Poke   and break up the clumps of pork so that it looks crumbled.  Add the   green onion, sugar, white pepper and soy sauce; toss together to   blend.      Return the reserved green beans, chicken stock and sesame oil; toss   vigorously over high heat until all liquids are reduced and absorbed,   about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature.      Serves 4 to 6.

It's a major product in Thailand and I saw   "tapioca trees" all over the place.  The plant itself isn't a tree,   but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set   upright in the fields so they don't rot during the rainy season.   Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks   like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be   removed by cooking.  Those little balls are actually made++like   risotto or "rice pasta".  It's usually used to make sweet puddings   here, but in the Orient it's used to make thick, savory soups.  Like   this one!      Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot   stock into a bowl and stir in the pork.  Return mixture to the pan.   Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook   for 5 to 10 minutes.  When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat   and season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat.

The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.         Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.      Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper   on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over   the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for   the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes   about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on   several wrappers at a time.      When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of   filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the   sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.      After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,   put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,   and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is   Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).      To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:      Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint   leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the   directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc   cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,   2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each   person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the   nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using   chopsticks or a fork.      Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.      Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables   on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a   cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips   it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.      NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps   them crisper than frying in any other oil.

I haven't tried this   one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her   stuff is usually bang-on.      In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles   in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree   ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop   and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch   lengths; set aside.      Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add   tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your   hands.      Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish   sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10   minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated   carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.      To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow   pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a   second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a   wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens   to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.      Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact   log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log   along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the   log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper   is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to   enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the   wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.      Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover   with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.      To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat   fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.   Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).   Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to   8 minutes.      Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.      Serving suggestions:      Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces .  Dip into sauce and   enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of   coriander and mint.  Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part   of a multi course meal.      NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray   with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate   them overnight, wrapped in plastic.  Don't keep them longer than 1   day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and   frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet   and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.      Makes 16 rolls.

1/2 c  Long Grain Rice     1/2 c  Glutinous Rice       5 qt Chicken Broth       1 lb Ground Pork       1 tb Dark Soy Sauce       1 t  Salt       2 ea Green Onion Stalks      12 ea Water Chestnuts     Rinse rice 2 or 3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water   chestnuts. Mix with ground pork, soy sauce and salt.   Bring stock and rice to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3 hours or   until the rice breaks down completely and the soup becomes thick and   creamy. Turn heat up and add ground pork mixture, shaping 1 tsp at a time   into a small ball and dropping it into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes or   until pork balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve in individual soup   bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person to choose his or her   favourite toppings. I like Nam-Yuey in mine!   You can make this ahead of time and reheat.   You can also use chicken slices, ground beef, beef slices, fish filets or   ham slices. A roast chicken or turkey carcass is excellent for making the   stock. Just cook the carcass, rice and water together. Take out the   carcass when the soup is done. I add Duck Liver Sausage bits!   Condiments which you can use:   Sesame oil, White Pepper, Green Onions, Chinese Parsley (cilantro), tea   melon (sweet cucumber), Szechwan turnips, chopped peanuts, Deep Fried   Devils (Yao Ja Guai, which are small fried bread sticks), NAM-YUEY!

3 c  Oil       2 lb String beans     3/4 lb Ground pork     1/2 T  Dried shrimp       4 T  Dry sherry       2 T  Szechuan mustard green     1/4 c  Chicken broth     1/4 c  Water       1 T  Soy sauce       1 T  Sesame oil     Rinse the beans and break off the ends; dry them thoroughly to reduce   spattering during deep-frying.  Rinse and mince the Szechuan mustard green.      Wash the dried shrimp and soak them in sherry for 1 hour.  Drain them,   reserving the sherry.  Mince the shrimp.      Mix the sherry from the shrimp with the chicken broth, water, soy sauce and   sesame oil.  Reserve.      Heat the oil in a wok (or deep pan) until a bamboo chopstick sizzles when   put into the oil.  Deep fry the beans in 5 or 6 batches, until they develop   brown blisters and shrivel slightly. Remove them batch by batch; drain each   batch and keep them warm while you remove all but 2 T oil from the pan.      Heat the 2 T of oil until very hot and add the ground pork.  Stir fry until   it is broken up into very small pieces and no longer is pink. Add the   minced shrimp and Szechuan mustard green.  Stir for 30 seconds. Add the   string beans and stir to mix well for about 15 seconds.      Add the liquid ingredients, toss until the liquid is reduced to 2   tablespoons.  Serve on a warmed platter.  
2 lb Ground meat (mixed            -ground beef and            -ground pork)       1 md Onion     1/2    Green pepper       5    Garlic cloves       1    Cilantro bunch     1/2 t  Red pepper     1/2 t  Salt     1/2 t  Cumin (or more)     1/2 c  Wine or sherry     3/4 c  Black olives   1 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce     1/2 c  Tomato sauce            -(1 small can)      12    Corn tortillas     1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese     1/2 c  Sour cream (optional)            Oil     Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground meats.   Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the chopped green   pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for another minute or two   (until green pepper is cooked bright green).  Drain well, then add (about)   several tablespoons of the enchilada sauce and cook for a few minutes   longer. Set aside.      Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce (from   the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry, cumin, salt,   red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how compulsive you   are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and spicy.      Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the   enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy (you'll   be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.      The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some of   its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package, separate them   from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the frying pan surface on   each side, to moisten them slightly with the grease. That done, stack them   in the frying pan and heat them until they are soft and pliable.      The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed:  Take the   tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven  dish, curved into a   "U" shape, each right next to its neighbor.  (At this point, start heating   your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan.  I usually wind up preparing 10   tortillas in all.)      Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed by an   appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive halves.  Then   curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the opposite end, and   carefully rotate it to conceal the seam.  Each tortilla should be filled   firmly (not too loosely) but not overflowing the ends.      Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled   tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the   crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover with   aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the tortillas are soft   and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5 minutes, then serve, topped   with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail to drain the meat well enough, the   enchiladas will be greasy. If over-baked, it tastes all right, but the   tortillas lose their texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite   forgiving in its proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own   tolerance for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours   before baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for   a day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and some   Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.

Place cooked rice in a container and mix with the oil to coat well. Cover   and set aside. Charcoal grill the pork over medium heat until well done.   Drizzle some of the marinating liquid on each side halfway through the   cooking time. In a small sauce pan, bring the rest of marinating liquid to   a boil and pour into a gravy bowl. Slice pork into 1" X 1 1/2" pieces and   about 1/4" thick. Spread the rice onto a platter. Cover with the pork   pieces and pour the marinating liquid over the pork. Sprinkle cilantro,   green onions and chilies. Garnish with sliced cucumbers and tomatoes.      Shared by Gail Shimizu (BWHT68A)

NOTES:      *  A Mexican meat and bean dish, similar to chili -- I got this recipe from   "A Primer on Bean Cookery" by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board. While   not a true chili, chalupa is a Mexican-American favorite for a hearty lunch   or supper. It may be made ahead and reheated, and it freezes well.      *  Chili powder is a mixture of spices, consisting mainly of ground dried   chili peppers.  This recipe may be served with corn chips and condiments   (including chopped tomato, chopped avocado, chopped onion, shredded   lettuce, grated cheddar cheese and hot sauce).      : Difficulty:  Easy.   : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5-6 hours cooking.   : Precision:  no need to measure.      : Jeff Lichtman   : Relational Technology, Inc.   : {amdahl, sun}!rtech!jeff    {ucbvax, decvax}!mtxinu!rtech!jeff      : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust

Combine marinade ingredients and the   garlic clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate   the chicken.  Turn chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook,   preheat the broiler to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces   on the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted butter   mixture.  (Reserve part of the basting mixture to serve over the   chicken when served.)  Broil the chicken 3-4 inches from the heat for   5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices run   clear when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove to serving platter,   pour reserved basting mixture over the chicken breasts and serve   immediately. This is also good done on a BBQ.

Mix all other sauce ingredients in   2-quart saucepan. Reserve. Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken   meat from bones.  Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1"   chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water   chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg   beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat   thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a   lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.   Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat   (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a   light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.   Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or   paper bag. Reserve. Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk   first:  chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2   minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry   no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to   keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long   chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:  While deep-frying   chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions & peanuts about a   minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken pieces to   sauce, mix quickly & serve.

Mix cheese, breadcrumbs,   minced parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in   medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb   mixture, coating completely and pressing to adhere.  Shake off excess   breadcrumbs.  Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add   chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4   minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels and drain.   Transfer chicken to platter. Melt butter in small saucepan. Mix in   lemon juice and pour over chicken.  Garnish with lemon wedges and   parsley sprigs. *** My notes:  I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and   breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I reduced   the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for 6   breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just   enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

Preheat the oven to 200.   2. Cut the chicken breast crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Place the   chicken in a small bowl.   3. Add 6 tablespoons of the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the coriander   (if using), the cumin, cornstarch, salt and pepper and mix gently until   the chicken is well coated; set aside.   4. Stack the tortillas and wrap them in foil. Place them in the oven to   warm for 5 to 10 minutes.   5. Maenwhile make the sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the salsa and   the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of   coriander (if using).   6. Shred the lettuce.   7. In a medium skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the   chicken and saute until white and firm, about 5 minutes.   8. Place the tortillas, chicken, shredded lettuce, sauce and sour cream in   serving dishes. The diners can then assemble their own fajitas by   topping a tortilla with some of each of the ingredients, ending with a   dollop of sour cream, and then rolling it up.   TIME-SAVERS:   MICROWAVE TIP: Just before serving, stack the tortillas and wrap them in a   damp paper towel. Cook at 100% for 1 minute.   DO-AHEAD: Since the fajitas are fine served at room temperature, much of   the preparation can be done ahead of time. The sauce (Step 5) can be   made and the chicken marinated in advance.

With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar,   orange juice, and lime juice.  Add the Scotch bonnet pepper,. onion,   and green onions and mix well.  Add the chicken breasts, cover and   marinate for at least 1 hour,  longer if possible.       Preheat an outdoor grill.       Remove the breasts from the marinade and grill for 6 minutes on   each side or until fully cooked.  While grilling, baste with the   marinade.       Heat the leftover marinade and serve on the side for dipping.       NOTE:  This is the recipe as listed in the cookbook.  Per-   sonally, I would NEVER heat the leftover marinade and serve on the   side for dipping, especially something that you had marinated POULTRY   in.  A MUCH better idea would be to reserve some of the marinade   (BEFORE you put the chicken in it) and save it for serving.       This recipe is also from Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking by Devra   Dedeaux.  "This recipe is not as hot as you would find in Jamaica.   For that authentic flavor, double the quantity of dry spices."

Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then bone each   piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat   in one piece.  Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast   or leg-thigh fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken   come to room temperature before blackening.    Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a   small bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over   very high heat until it is extremely hot and just   short of the point at which you see white ash or a   white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8   minutes.

Let the chicken   come to room temperature before blackening.    Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a   small bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over   very high heat until it is extremely hot and just   short of the point at which you see white ash or a   white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8   minutes.  (the time will vary according to the   plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each   piece of chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that   both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each fillet   evenly with the seasoning mix, using about a rounded   1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with your   hands.  (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other   surface to season it, be sure the surface is warm so   the butter won't congeal and stick to the surface   instead of to the meat.  Wipe the surface clean after   seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning   mix in another recipe.)      Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in   the hot skillet, making sure all meat folds are opened   up and the meat is lying flat.  Pour about 1 teaspoon   butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as the   butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet   at a time, place each fillet in the skillet before   buttering and seasoning another one.    Cook uncovered   over the same high heat until the underside forms a   crust, about 2 minutes.  (The time will vary according   to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the   skillet or fire;  watch the meat and you'll see a   white line coming up the side as it cooks.)  Turn the   fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon more melted   butter on top of each.  Cook just until meat is cooked   through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken   fillets crustier side up while piping hot.    Clean   the skillet after cooking each batch and repeat the   blackening procedure with the remaining chicken   fillets.    To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1   leg-thigh fillet on each heated serving plate.  If you   use a large serving platter, do not stack the fillets.   Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done   either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The   process creates an incredible amount of smoke that   will set off your own and your neighbors' smoke   alarms.  People with really well-installed commercial   hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in   their own kitchens.  They are privileged!  Don't push   your luck."

Allow the batter to sit, covered for at least 30 minutes.   Combine the chicken with the batter. Heat a wok or large deep skillet until   it is hot and add the oil for frying. When the oil is barely smoking,   deep-fry the chicken for 2 minutes or until the batter is just firm. You   should do this in several batches. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon   and drain on paper towels.      TO MAKE SAUCE: Heat a small saucepan; when it is hot, add the oil, ginger   and garlic, and stir for 30 seconds. Then add the rest of the sauce   ingredients and simmer for 2 minutes. Keep warm. Reheat the oil in the wok   until it is very hot, but not smoking. Deep-fry the chicken again until it   is golden and crisp, about 1 minute. Remove and drain, place on a warm   platter, drizzle with the sauce and serve immediately.

Refold the breast,   enclosing the ham. Lay the breast on a sheet of caul fat. Roll up tight.   The caul is sticky, so it needs nothing to seal it. Dust the surface with   water chestnut powder, flour or cornstarch. Shake off the excess. Heat the   oil in a wok to 350F (moderate). Slide the chicken breasts into the oil, 1   by 1. When they have browned (about 5 minutes), remove 1 from the oil and   press it. If it feels mushy, it needs more cooking. Remove and drain the   chicken. Slice the chicken, crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.      VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a wok and flavor with garlic and ginger.   Remove the garlic and ginger and add the water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and   scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add soy sauce, wine or   sherry, and chicken broth. When the liquid boils, stir in the dissolved   cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread the sauce on a platter as a bed for   the sliced chicken breast.

Crush and break up pulp with a fork   and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press   it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep   saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper   bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the   oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds.   Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat   with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it   at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are   done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil   over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1   minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and   set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to   the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add   tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a   dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the   wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3   to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the   reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer   together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture,   green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through.   Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently   crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of   noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat.   Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace   (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.      CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep   oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a   medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let   eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until   lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular   lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break   into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. ---

(The word Hammin (or Hammim) is derived from the Hebrew adjective Ham or   warm which describes certain dishes that are kept warm for prolonged   periods of time...In Pitigliano, however Hammin was the classic one-course   meal for Passover that both rich and poor used to make. The only difference   between the versions was the in the cuts of meat used. Poor people used   breast of lamb..and meatballs made with beef(when the cost of ground beef   was a fraction of the cost of chicken.) People who didn't have to worry   about the cost used tiny rib chops from baby lamb and chicken balls."      Combine ground chicken, 1 Tbsp olive oil, egg, matza meal and 2 Tbsp broth   in small bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix well. In large   pot, place the lamb with remaining oil, sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and 1/4   tsp pepper and lightly brown for 2-3 minutes. Add garlic, parsley and 1 cup   of warm water. Form many tiny bowls with the ground chicken mixture and   gently add to pot with lamb. Cover and simmer 1 to 1/2 hours. Add spinach   and 1 Tsp salt and simmer, covered, 15 minutes longer. Transfer the lamb   chops, half the spinach and most of the gravy to a hot serving dish and   keep warm. Add remaining broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add matza pieces   and cook 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and let stand 5 minutes before   serving as a soup. Serve the lamb and spinach as the main dish. SERVES: 6-8

Our classic soup was a   chicken soup with rice to which were added balls of chicken breast and   whole immature eggs (which are still at the stage where the outer shell and   white have not yet formed; they are perfectly round and vary from less than   1" to less than 1 mm in diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with   the white rice, the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens   raised on private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature   eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.      Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten egg   with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add ground chicken,   salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in the refrigerator for   at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny balls, no larger than the   egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add rice, chicken balls and cook,   covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs, discard whites and place one hard   boiled egg yolk in each of the eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg   yolks and serve immediately.

Combine with the other ingredients   (except chicken) and mix well.  Season highly. Place each breast skin side   up on a board.  Trim away excess fat.  Loosen skin from 1 side of breast   and stuff approximately 1/3 cup of the filling under the skin. Tuck the   skin and meat under breast, forming an even, round, dome shape. Put the   stuffed breasts in a buttered Pyrex or metal baking dish. Fifteen minutes   before baking, preheat over to 350 F (175 C).  Bake breasts until golden   brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Don't overcook or chicken will be dry. Cool   slightly before serving, and cool to room temperature if you are going to   slice into smaller serving pieces.  Arrange on platters and decorate with   fresh herbs.

With a feather   brush dipped in cold water lightly brush the top to maintain moisture.   Place mounds of spinach mixture on the dough in straight lines about 2   inches apart (measurements are from the centers of the mounds), making 8 or   9 dozen of them. Roll out the other half of the dough paper thin and place   loosely over the sheet with the mounds. With an Italian pastry wheel, press   along the furrows, cutting and sealing at the same time.    Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add ravioli and 3 Tbsp salt. Stir until   boiling resumes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, uncovered. Drain and serve with   marinara or meat sauce. SERVES: 6-8

Add   the egg white, pepper and desired salt and mix well. Taste for salt and   pepper and add if desired. Cover the bowl and set aside for 30 minutes   before using. Combine onions and oil in a small Dutch oven or casserole,   place in the oven and turn temperature to 375F. If using fresh plum   tomatoes, bring a pot of water to the boil, plunge in the plum tomatoes and   cook a minute or so, until the skins crack. Drain tomatoes and when they   are cool enough to handle, peel them. Discard peels, cut tomatoes in half   crosswise and squeeze out seeds. Add tomatoes to the Dutch oven. Remove   stems from the dried chili peppers and remove the seeds. Add peppers to the   Dutch oven. Add cumin, cream and salt as desired. Cook 30 minutes, remove   from the oven and scrape the contents into a blender or food processor.   Blend until smooth and set aside. Meanwhile, place a piece of cheese under   the skin of each breast, dredge each breast in flour and shake off the   excess. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat on the stove. When   the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), dip each breast in the beer batter   and let the excess run off. Place skin-side down in the oil and fry until   golden. Turn and fry other side, about 1 minute per side. Remove breasts   from the oil as they are done, drain on paper towels and transfer to a   baking dish. Place the chicken breasts in a preheated 375F oven for 15   minutes. Place tomato sauce in a saucepan and reheat. (If the mixture is   too thin, place it in a saucepan over high heat and boil down.) Pour the   sauce onto a platter and arrange the chicken breasts on top.

Scrape the   mixture into a food processor, add basil and puree until coarsely ground.   Add onion mixture to the pasta in the mixing bowl and add egg white and   bread crumbs. Mix well. Chill in the refrigerator. Pull the tenderloins off   the meat side of each breast and set aside. Remove the skin in 1 piece and   set aside. Place breasts between layers of plastic wrap or wax paper and   flatten to a 3/8-inch thickness. Gently flatten the tenderloins. Lay the   breasts down on what was their skin side and place about 1/3 cup stuffing   on each breast, leaving a 1-inch border. Gather up the edges around the   stuffing as best you can.

Remove from heat and let the contents of the pan steep, covered, for 5   minutes. Remove the chicken breasts to a plate and return the pan to the   stove. Place over medium heat and cook uncovered for 5 minutes, reducing   the liquid by 1/3. Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, let cool for 10   minutes, then transfer the mixture to a blender. Running the blender on   medium, slowly add both oils. When it's time to put dinner on the table,   pour the sauce onto a platter, and place a pile of snow peas in the center   of the plate. Slice the chicken diagonally across the grain into thin   strips. Fan chicken breasts around the snow peas. Arrange vegetables around   the chicken and sprinkle with cilantro.
