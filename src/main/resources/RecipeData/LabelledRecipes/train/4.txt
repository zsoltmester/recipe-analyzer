1    Text Only     A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.      Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been   thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways of   preparing dry beans for cooking.  All start with a thorough inspection for   damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in cold water.  The next   step, which is highly recommended, is soaking the beans.  This not only   helps make the beans cook faster, it also improves flavor, texture,   appearance and digestibility.  For maximum improvement of these factors, it   is recommended that the soak water be discarded and the beans rinsed and   cooked in fresh water.      SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.      For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.   Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so be sure   to start with a large enough pot.  (Note:  up to 2 teaspoons of salt per   pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.)   Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover and   set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak method), but *preferably* four   hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater   amount of the gas-causing properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping   the beans to be more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects.   Whether you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to   DISCARD THE SOAK WATER.      COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)      Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized   kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2   teaspoons salt.  Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness is   reached.      Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons onion salt   and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Add 1 Tablespoon   chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.      * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.      * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.      * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans when   cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.      * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker helps,   but follow manufacturer's directions.  [Personal note:  Tom says 1/2 hour   in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to cooking them   overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure cooker, as they   expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)      * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or kidney   beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings, lard, oil,   butter or margarine.

I've done   this one and it's great.  As Julia says, "Because the garlic is boiled, its   after-effects are at a minimum, and its flavor becomes exquisite, aromatic   and almot undefinable."      From Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. I":      Drop garlic cloves in boiling water and boil for 30 seconds.  Drain, run   cold water over them and peel.  Place the garlic and the rest of the   ingredients in a 3-quart saucepan and boil slowly for 30 minutes. Correct   seasoning.      3 egg yolks 3 to 4 T. olive oil      Beat the egg yolks with a wire whip in a soup tureen for a minute or until   they are thick and sticky.  Drop by drop beat in the olive oil for making a   mayonnaise.      Rounds of hard-toasted French bread 1 cup of grated Swiss or Parmesan   cheese      Just before serving, beat a ladleful of hot soup into the egg mixture by   droplets.  Gradually strain in the rest, beating and pressing the juice out   of the garlic.  Serve immediately, accompanied by the bread and cheese.      Posted by Al Martin. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

VARIATIONS:  For thinner soup, use less flour.  For vegetables with a more   delicate flavor, use less bouillon powder.  If using sliced mushrooms,   asparagus and frozen or fresh green peas as vegetables, use slightly less   flour, slightly less bouillon powder, and a dash of sugar. (Start with the   asparagus, adding peas and mushrooms when asparagus is almost done. No   onion in that one, BTW, it would overwhelm the other flavors.) If all   you've got is potatoes and onions, add quarter teaspoon caraway seeds early   on (when you reduce to simmering).  What, not even potatoes? Throw in   somewhat more chopped onion and add rice, and serve with fresh chopped   parsley.      Posted by Karin Brewer. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

2 1/2 c  Dried black beans, soaked            -overnight       1 lg Or 2 small ham hocks       3    To 3.5 quarts water       3 tb Olive oil       2    To 3 large onions       4    Cloves garlic       3 sm Fresh green peppers            -(jalapeanos if preferred)       8    Berries allspice coarsely            -crushed       2 ts Brown sugar (or 1 t of            -molasses)       3 tb Tomato paste     3/4 c  Creme fraiche or sour cream     Salt Grated rind and juice from one lemon      Put the drained beans and hock in a very large pan, cover with the cold   water and bring gradually to a boil.  Leave to simmer while you prepare the   other ingredients.      In a frying pan heat the olive oil, then gently fry the onion, garlic and   chili with the allspice and lemon rind, stirring occasionally, until the   onions are translucent.  Add this mixture to the beans and go on simmering   for 2 hours, by which time the beans should be tender.  At this point add   the sugar, lemon juice, and tomato puree.  Cook for another 30 minutes. Add   salt if necessary.      Remove the hock, and pick off any meat.  If you would like a smooth soup,   as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and return with   the meat to the pan.  Otherwise, for a rougher texture crush with a potato   masher.  If the mixture seems too thick at this stage, add more water and   bring back to the boil for a minute or two.      Ladle the soup into bowls, with a spoonful or two of cream stirred in, and   serve with a crusty bread.      If you are feeling lavish, a couple of spoons of dark rum added towards the   end give a Bajan fillip.      INFO TEXT: Arriving stiff and crumpled inside and out after an eleven hour   flight, this was my first taste of Bajan Cooking, and I ate it late at   night trying to imagine the sea beyond a dark frieze of langourous palms.   Dense but smooth, with a snap of chili, the soup was both homely and   exotic, and very restoring.      Barbados produces splendid ham and bacon, and a ham stock is what makes   this different from other Carribean variants.  Or, as here, use a hock,   soaked first to remove some salt.

Note:  If this is just for the family, I toss all of the diced vegetables   right into the soup as it's chilling (it doesn't last long enough for the   veggies to get limp).  And I might go to the trouble of making croutons, or   maybe not.      Posted by Barb Burgess. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

In a large heavy pot combine all the soup ingredients except the   raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat while preparing the   meatballs.      2.  Combine meatball ingredients, stirring them to mix thoroughly. With wet   hands, roll the meat mixture in 1 1/4" balls.  Add the meatballs to the   boiling cabbage soup, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 2   hours.      3.  Remove the cover, add the raisins, and cook for another 30 minutes in   the uncovered pot.      She suggests that mashed potatoes would be an excellent accompaniment.   Also, that the dish goes well with broad egg noodles.      Posted by Sheila Exner. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

1    Text Only     Wash soup bones.  Put on aluminum lined tray and brown in a 400F oven until   well browned on both sides.  Put bones in soup pot, drain grease and then   get as much of the browned bits as possible using a little water to help   them along.  Add water until the bones are well covered. Turn on heat. Add   carrots, onions, celery, tomatoes (whatever goes with the soup) some salt   and pepper and let simmer most of the day. Remove bones and chop what meat   there is.  Throw out the vegetables and skim off as much fat as possible   (if left in refrigerator overnight it will come to the top and get hard and   can be removed easily).  Put chopped meat back, add 3 quarts whole tomatoes   (mashed), a couple of cubed potatoes, and about a half package of frozen   mixed vegetables.  Let simmer until potatoes are done and until needed. The   soup is better the next day. Cooked noodles can be added.      Posted by Pat Stockett. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

" Our black bean soup is a Silver Palate staple.  In this recipe we've   dressed it up with lots of hot and garlicky sausages, sweet red peppers, a   bit of brown sugar, and unusual spices.  This makes a meal when served with   a crisp, tart green salad."      Sour cream      1.  Soak the black beans in water to cover overnight.      2.  Heat 1 cup of the oil in a large heavy stock pot over low heat. Add the   onions and garlic and saute until the onions are limp, about 10 minutes.      3.  Drain and rinse the beans and add to the stock pot.  Add the ham bone   and 6 quarts of the water.  Stir in the cumin, oregano, bay leaves, salt,   pepper, cayenne, and 3 tablespoons of the parsely.  Heat to boiling. Reduce   heat to medium and cook uncovered at a slow rolling boil for 2 hours,   skimming foam from the top and stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.      4.  Place the garlic sausage in a medium-size saucepan and add the   remaining 2 quarts water.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low and simmer   for 40 minutes.  Drain.  Remove casings and cut into 1/2-inch slices.      5.  Heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large heavy skillet over medium   heat.  Add the Italian sausages and saute until browned.  Remove the   sausages with a slotted spoon.      6.  In the same skillet, saute the bratwurst until browned.  Remove with a   slotted spoon.      7.  After 2 hours of cooking, process 2 cups of the beans in a food   processor fitted with a steel blade until smooth and return to the pot.   Continue to cook for 30 minutes.      8.  Add all the sausages and the red peppers and cook for another 30   minutes.      9.  Remove the ham bone from the soup, shred the meat and return to the   pot.  Stir in the sherry, sugar, and lemon juice.      10.  Cook over medium heat until the beans are very soft and the soup is   thick, 30 to 45 minutes.  Stir in the remaining 5 tablespoons chopped   parsley.  Taste and adjust seasonings.      11.  Ladle the soup into soup bowls and dollop each serving with sour   cream.      Makes 16 portions.

Soak peas in water   overnight in fridge.  The next day, throw out water they soaked in; some   claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay on this diet a   couple weeks and you won't have a problem anyway.  It goes away.  Wash stew   meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked peas in big pot on stove and bring to   boil, with PLENTY of water.  Add seasonings to taste.  If you use Cajun   seasoning it contains salt; so don't add extra salt!!!!  Otherwise, add   salt to taste.  When stew meat and peas come to a boil, reduce to Medium   and keep watching to add water so they don't scorch.  After about 40   minutes add packet of Rice and Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor.  Start   watching the water really carefully now, and add a pint from time to time.   After about 20 minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more   seasonings if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery)  Everything   should be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat!

3    Cups+ of half-and-half and            -heated the chowder to just            -below the boiling     I visited with the creator of this wonderful chowder and though he did not   give me the recipe, he did share some hints.  He uses only cream and   butter, no wimpy milk for him.  He starts with a roux with chopped celery   and onion and adds thyme, bay leaf and white pepper for seasoning. If fresh   clams are not available, he recommends Snow's Chopped Clams.      Using his tips, what I know about clam chowder and a little research, I   created a very good clam chowder the other night.  I don't have the   ingredient amounts, but it doesn't really matter if you've had some kitchen   experience.  The real secret came from Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana   Kitchen cookbook.  I figured if I was going to mess with a roux, I might as   well start with the expert roux maker.      I made a 50/50 oil/flour roux --- using 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup   butter and 1/2 cup flour.  I heated the oil as high as I dared and put in   about 1/3 of the flour allowing it to foam and let the moisture in the   flour escape --- be careful!  Roux can burn like hellfire.  I continued to   add the flour and cooked the roux to a light golden color. I removed the   roux from the heat and added about 1/2 cup finely chopped onions and 1/2   cup finely chopped celery.  The hot roux cooks the veggies and the veggies   cool down the roux.      I drained the liquid from 4 7-ounce cans of clams and added a 7- ounce   bottle of clam juice.  I put the clam nectar in a sauce pan and added about   1 1/2 lbs of raw potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes.  I added some   thyme and a couple of bay leaves and some freshly ground white pepper.      When the potatoes were cooked, I added some of the roux to thicken the   chowder.  I ended up using all the roux.  I added the clams and about   point, stirring frequently and tasted it for seasoning adjustment. Toward   the end, I threw in a handful of real bacon bits for an added smokey   flavor.  I topped the pot with 1/2 cube of butter and let it sit for about   an hour to allow the flavors to blend.      The result was the best clam chowder I have ever made.  To complete the   dinner I served sweet cornbread and a carrot and raisin salad.      Sorry, the amounts are not precise, but if you plan ahead, it's difficult   to go wrong.

In spite of the fact that I forgot to finish it with the browned   flour and butter, it turned out pretty darn good, if a tad bland. (I did   cheat and use real butter instead of oleo.) Here's the recipe. Never having   had black bean soup before, let alone making it, I'm not sure what would be   kosher to liven it up a bit. Anyone have any tips? I served it with   cornbread and a plate of sliced home grown tomatoes. BTW, the recipe is   transcribed exactly as it appears in the book to give a taste of Mickler's   writing style. Pretty neat stuff, though I'm not sure if I'm ready for the   cold collard sandwich yet...      Salt and pepper to taste      Put your beans in a soup pot and cover with water. Boil, take off the fire   and let sit until cool. Cook onions and bell peppers in 1/2 the oleo until   limp. Add them and the ham hocks and orange to the cooled beans; cover   charitably with water. Simmer until beans is soft (1 to 2 hours). Fish out   the orange right now, before it gets tore up. With the rest of the oleo,   brown the flour in a black frying pan, then stir it into the beans. Brenda   says: "Make sure you got a soup, now. If you need to add some more water,   do it."      From "White Trash Cooking", Ernest Matthew Mickler. Ten Speed Press, 1986.   ISBN 0-89815-189-9.

Mixture will thicken more upon sitting.      Makes 6 cups.      NOTE:  I like to cut down a bit on the richness this soup has by using 2%   milk; and Velveeta "Light" cheese.  Keep stirring-as it may burn.  Do not   cook for more than 25 minutes as it becomes a great cheese sauce after a   while-good for pouring over potatoes-but not good if you want soup.

In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate   heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes.  Add the   asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes.  Add the salt,   pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to   moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15 minutes.      2.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the   heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle   about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly.   Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the   saucepan.  Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking   constantly, until it just thickens, about 8 minutes.  Do not allow the soup   to boil or the eggs will curdle.  Remove from the heat.      3.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl.  Ladle the hot   soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.      Serves 6.      NOTE:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in   which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or   slightly stale bread.  Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.      Posted by Michelle Bass. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

Squeeze 1/4 cup fresh orange juice. Clean   the carrots and trim the stems.  If the carrots are small, cook whole; if   they are larger, cut into any shape so they will cook in about 10 minutes.   Peel the turnips and cut into 1/2 inch pieces.  In a saucepan, cook the   vegetables in the orange juice on slow heat until tender. Add the chicken   stock and let the vegetables steep on a slow flame for another 10 to 15   minutes.  Remove to a blender and puree until smooth; correct the   seasonings.  Make a compound butter by combining the orange rind, honey,   mustard and herbs with softened butter.  Halve the plums and then slice   each half into thin slices that can be fanned out. Ladle the soup into   bowls; garnish with a piece of the compound butter and the plums.      Posted by Sharon Stevens. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

Score chestnuts on their rounded sides and toss them   in just enough oil to lightly coat them. Place chestnuts on baking sheet.   Bake until skins have opened and meat is tender, about 20 minutes. When   cool enough to handle, peel and dice them into small pieces. Set aside.   Rinse lentils and combine them in soup pot with the water. Bring to boil.   Cook a few minutes at gentle boil, removing foam that forms on surface. Add   carrot, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaf, salt and parsley. Lower heat and   simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes. When done, remove   parsley sprigs and bay leaf. Correct seasoning and add salt, if necessary.   Puree half the lentils until smooth, then recombine them with the rest.   FINISHING THE SOUP: In pan large enough to hold soup, warm olive oil, then   add roasted chestnuts and herbs. Cook over medium heat, stirring   frequently, for several minutes. Add wine and tomato paste. Stir to   dissolve tomato paste and cook a few minutes to reduce wine. Stir in lentil   mixture and simmer gently 20 minutes. If soup is too thick, thin it with a   little water, stock or cream until of right consistency. Taste for salt and   season with pepper. Serve with spoonful of olive oil swirled into each   bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and croutons, if desired.      DEBORAH MADISON - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK

Turn the heat down to low   and let simmer, uncovered, while you continue.      Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions and   saute for 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the celery and carrot; saute for another 5   minutes, then add the vegetables to the simmering chicken stock along with   the tomato paste, brandy, turnip and butternut squash. Simmer gently,   covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.      Meanwhile, make the meatballs.  In a food processor whizz together the   bread, garlic and egg for about 30 seconds until a smooth paste is formed.   Add the chicken, ham, pepper and the basil and/or parsley. Pulse-chop 10 to   15 times, then process until a smooth, very thick paste is formed.      Roll the meat paste into balls the size of a large marble.  Roll the balls   in the flour so that they are lightly dusted all over.      When the vegetables are tender, raise the heat slightly so that the soup   simmers with a little more intensity.  Drop the meatballs into the soup and   let cook for 5 to 7 minutes.  Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.   Be careful not to oversalt as the ham is salty.  Serve immediately.      Serves 6 to 8 as an entre with bread and salad.      NOTE:  This is even better the next day, but first remove the meatballs and   wrap them separately rather than storing them overnight with the broth.

Remove the giblets, scrub out the internal cavity under cold running   water, and scrape away anything that doesn't look edible. (But DO NOT   remove the chicken skin or any of the fat!  You need the skin to make a   rich stock.) Next, take a crock pot (see Note below if you don't have a   crock pot) and place the chicken and giblets into it.  Then drop in the   diced onions, the 1/2 c of celery, the 1/2 c of minced parsley, the garlic,   chopped carrots, bay leaves, poultry seasoning and 2 quarts of water. Then,   with a spoon, evenly distribute the seasoning mixture around the chicken,   turn the crock pot to HIGH, and cook for at least six hours (or better   still, OVERNIGHT).  Remember, the longer you cook, the richer the base   stock and the more tender the chicken.  While the chicken is slow-cooking,   it's a good time to prepare your noodles      Go ahead and boil them according to package directions... but DO NOT COOK   THEM UNTIL DONE!  Keep in mind that you're going to drop them into a soup,   so you want them el dente (firm), otherwise they'll turn to pure mush by   the time you eat them.  Furthermore, you want a small percent of the starch   in the noodles to cook into the soup to thicken it slightly - if you cook   the noodles all the way, the soup's consistency will be flat and thin.   After the noodles are cooked, butter them slightly and set them aside. When   the chicken is tender, take a set of tongs or a strainer spoon, remove it   from the crock pot (it may tend to fall apart, but that's okay), and set it   on a platter to cool.  At this point, strain out all the seasoning   vegetables from the stock, place the stock into a metal bowl, and place the   bowl into the refrigerator or freezer until the chicken fat congeals (which   should take about 1 hour).  Meanwhile, pick the chicken off the bones and,   with a sharp knife, chop it into bit-sized pieces. Then, in a heavy 12-inch   skillet, melt the butter and saute the sliced onions, mushrooms, and   carrots until they're tender.  Then drop in the chopped chicken meat. And   over medium-low heat, cook it into the vegetables for about 10 minutes.   While the chicken and vegetables are sauteing, remove the chicken stock   from the refrigerator, skim off all the fat, and place the skimmed stock   into a soup pot, along with the remaining 2 quarts of water. At this point,   you should season the soup stock to taste with salt and pepper. Now drop in   the sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onion rings and diced carrots - along with   the sherry, the Tabasco*, and as soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the   heat to low and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes to allow all the   flavors to thoroughly blend. When you're ready to eat, ladle out heaping   helpings of the piping hot soup into bowls, garnish with a sprinkling of   thinly sliced green onions, and serve with crunch saltines.      *I just put a couple of drops of Tabasco in there      NOTE:  I found a REAL bargain on chicken hindquarters, so used them... was   out of parsley, so omitted that.  USED the mushrooms and they are heavenly   in it.  Didn't use the sherry, though I think it would be really good. And   was out of flat noodles, so used a good handful of vermicelli broken into   about 2" lengths, and just simmered in the soup.  It was REALLY good.

In a small bowl, combine the yogurt and oregano. Cover and   refrigerate.      TO MAKE THE CRISPS: Turn on your broiled, and position the rack at least 5   inches from the heat. Lightly brush the top of the tortilla wedges with   oil. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Sprinkle on the oregano,   crumbling it with your fingers as you do this, then drizzle on the Parmesan   cheese. Run them under the broiler, just to crisp and color lightly,   watching so they do not burn. Before serving, ladle the soup into bowls.   Add about a tablespoon of the yogurt in the center. Sprinkle on chopped   oregano and serve with the tortilla wedges.      NOTE: Although Tex-Mex and other Latin delicacies are now available in many   markets across the country, pickled nopales or tender cactus leaves are   less available than jalapeno peppers, for example. If you cannot find them,   either chop a few pickled jalapeno peppers (with the seeds removed) or   simply omit them.      JOANNA PRUESS - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK

8    Pieces of frying chicken (A            -3 to 4-pound chicken should            -do it.)     Cock-a-Leekie      A pound of beef shanks, hacked into stewing size  (about 1") 6 cups of   chicken stock.  (Canned is ok, but it's better if you make your own ahead   of time.) 3 slices of thick bacon or maybe salt pork, diced pretty fine. 1   Tblsp dried thyme.  (Whole is better!) 1 bay leaf 3/4 cup pearl barley.   (The kind you use in soup.) 1 1/2 cups of leeks. (Rinse and chop white   parts only.) Salt and pepper as you require.      You're going to need an 8-quart or better casserole that can stand up to   the stove burners.  Bring the whole thing to a boil, (leave out the barley,   leeks, salt and pepper.)  Simmer covered for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in   another part of the forest, bring the barley to a boil in 1 1/2 cups of   water for 10 min., drain and set it aside.  Debone the chicken when it's   done and set it aside. Add the leeks to the pot along with the barley and   simmer for 15 minutes. (Still with me?)  Then debone the beef and chop   coarsely.  Dump the beef and the chicken back in the pot and simmer,   covered, for 5 min. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.  Sing "Men of   Harlech."   Pour a single malt.  Serve.      And, if you're not up to Cock-a-Leekie ... In "A Moveable Feast" (sic)   Ernest Hemingway offers the following leek recipe: Trim leeks, leaving just   a smidgen of green and rinse them. Steam them for about 20 minutes or boil   them for about the same time, until they are reasonably tender. Meanwhile,   mix equal parts of extra-virgin olive oil and wine vinegar with a whisk in   a bowl. When leeks are cooked, cut into quarters lengthwise and put them in   a bowl of the oil/vinegar mix.  They should be just covered by the mix.   Cover the bowl and put in refrigimagrator for an hour or so. (Overnight is   even better, but St. David's Day is already upon us.)  Then dust them with   a healthy dose of fresh-ground pepper and serve as a salad or side dish.              8    Pieces of frying chicken (A            -3 to 4-pound chicken should            -do it.)

Peel and chunk in 2 1/2 of the avocados, reserving the   remaining half for garnish. Puree again, adding broth as necessary.      Transfer the soup to a large bowl. Add any remaining broth the buttermilk   to the blender and whir briefly to pick as much avocado as possible. Add to   the soup, along with the extract and sugar, if desired. Both of these   rather surprising ingredients enhance avocado when used in tiny amounts.   Stir well, taste and adjust the salt. The soup may be made to this in   advance and refrigerated several hours, but for best flavor allow it to   warm up a bit before serving. It should be cold but not icy.      Peel the remaining half avocado cut into very thin slices. Divide   soup-among six serving bowls and top with the sliced avocado, and   coriander. Serve accompanied by the tortilla chips.

Ten pounds of boiled crawfish make one pound of meat.   Peel crawfish, reserving shells and claws.  Rinse shells and let drain.   Melt butter in a large pot; add shells and fry until sizzling and hot,   turning them often.  When shells are hot enough, heat a small pot, pour in   brandy and ignite.  Remove shells from fire, pour in brandy, tossing and   turning until the flame dies down.      Add wine and water to cover shells.  Add onion, celery, green onions,   parsley, garlic, thyme and bay leaf.  Let it all simmer for an hour. Strain   carefully and reserve.      In another pot, melt butter, add flour and let cook on low fire until   medium brown.  Add chopped vegetables and let cook on a low fire until   wilted, stirring often.  Chop tomatoes and add to pot with reserved liquid.   Let cook a few minutes.      Add stock -- just enough to make a soupy consistency -- then add   Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, thyme, crawfish, corn and about four of the   cobs (for added flavor).  Let simmer an hour.  Taste for salt, pepper and   Tabasco.  If using boiled crawfish, it is usually peppery enough.      Remove the cobs and serve.      If the soup is too thick, add more stock or water.  If it's too thin, cook   a little more flour and add to thicken it.      Serves 8.      NOTE:  If you prefer to buy crawfish tails already picked, buy a couple of   pounds of boiled crawfish and pick them so as to have the shells to make   your stock.  Shrimp may be substituted.

1 lb Eggplant            Salt       2 oz Butter       1 md Onion, finely diced       2    Stalks celery, diced       1 ts Curry powder       1 pn Thyme       1 pn Basil       4 c  Chicken stock       1 c  Potato, diced     1/2 c  Cream     Salt Pepper Diced tomato, for garnish Chopped chives, for garnish      Dice the eggplant but do not peel.  Sprinkle a little salt over the   eggplant and leave to stand for about 30 minutes.  Put in a strainer and   run a little water over the dice, pat dry.  This removes any bitter taste   which would spoil the soup.      Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion, celery and eggplant.   Saute', stirring occasionally until the vegetables have slightly softened.   Eggplant absorbs butter very rapidly so you may have to add a little more   or the vegetables will stick.      Add the curry powder and fry to release the flavors.  Add thyme, basil,   chicken stock and the potato.  Cover and simmer until the vegetables are   quite soft, about 30 minutes.      Put the soup through a sieve or moulin and add the cream.  Taste for   seasoning.  Add a little diced tomato or chopped chives for garnish and   color.      This soup keeps well for several days.  However, if you intend making it   beforehand and keeping it, only add the cream when you reheat it. It   thickens as it stands, but it can be thinned with a little milk.

The canned product is, in fact, so universal,   reliable, and chameleon-like in flavor that it has become the base of a   thousand casseroles.   If you seek a more intense mushroom flavor, however, look no further. Erid   Lie, tooting his own horn, claims to have the answer to your prayers right   here.   Flour plays a part in the thickening of this soup, but the basic body and   emphatic statement of mushroom flavor come from cooking part of the   mushrooms with onions until they are mellow and lightly browned, then   pureeing them.   The flavor is further enhanced by adding sliced mushrooms before the final   heating.   ==========================================================================   1. Chop half the mushrooms; thinly slice the remaining mushrooms and set   aside.   2. Melt butter in a 5-6 quart pan over medium-high heat; add chopped   mushrooms, onion, and thyme. Stir often until the vegetables are lightly   browned, 15-20 minutes. Mix flour with vegetables.   3. Pour into a blender or food processor; whirl, adding as much broth as   needed to get the mixture smoothly pureed. Pour mixture back into pan; add   remaining broth, sliced mushrooms, bay leaf, and cream.   4. Bring soup to a boil on high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to   low and simmer to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add sherry, salt, and   pepper to taste. Make about 8 cups.      ~ Eric Lie, Edmonds, WA

Mince this peel and keep it in water with a little lemon juice until   needed.  Fry the curry powder in the butter until dark brown.  Stir in   about a quarter of the stock and cook until the mixture is smooth.  Add the   rest of the stock and the salt.  Mince the apples and drop immediately into   the stock in order that they do not discolor in the air.  Cover and allow   to simmer, gently, for 20 minutes or until the apples are soft.  Add the   apple juice and blend well.  Chill the soup for several hours, or until   needed.  Add the chilled cream just before serving.  Sprinkle a little   ginger on top when you serve and garnish with the minced apple peel, if   desired.      From How To Make Good Curries by Helen Lawson  Copyright 1973

Bring to a boil      Turn down the heat and let simmer a couple of hours until the beans start   to get tender, then heat 1/4 to 3/4 cup olive oil (how much will your   conscience allow?) and cook in it until tender but not browned      3 onions, chopped 2 green peppers, chopped 1 fresh jalepeno pepper, chopped   (optional) 4 to 6 cloves of garlic, pressed 1 to 3 teaspoons salt, maybe   more (taste it)      Stir this mixture into the simmering black beans and let cook until quite   tender and flavorful. More salt may be needed, and if you have a chance to   let the soup sit overnight at this point, it will be even better. If   desired, puree half or all of this to smoothness; we like it half-pureed,   half-chunky. If you do puree it, be sure to reheat it before serving it,   either as is or Cuban-style: bowls of steaming hot white rice and dishes of   chopped raw onions are on the table, and each person stirs as much or as   little rice and onions as they wish into their soup.

This will take about 2   months.  Cut vegetables into cubes (another 2 months).  Place meat in pan   and cover with 1,000 gallons of brown gravey and simmer for 4 weeks.      Shovel in salt and pepper to taste.  When the meat is tender, add the   vegetables.      A steam shovel is useful for this.      Simmer slowly for four more weeks.  Garnish with parsley.      If more are expected, add the two rabbits - this is not recommened, as very   few people like hare in their stew.      What's Cooking In Our National Parks Elaine Hounsell, Lake Mead NRA

Add salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the parsley and cheese.      NOTE:  There are dozens of quesos blancos, or white cheeses, which is   exactly how the name translates.  Some are soft, some fresh, but many aged.   Queso blanco generally is mild flavored, though some of the aged ones can   be quite tangy.  They are found in markets in Florida and in most cities   with colonies of residents of Caribbean, Cuban, or Mexican ancestry. Try   the cheeses, and choose the one that suits your taste.
