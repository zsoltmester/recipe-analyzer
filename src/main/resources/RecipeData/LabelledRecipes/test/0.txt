 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  4
      4    Artichokes, fresh ones
           -have tight leaves
      2    Green onions, finely
           -chopped
      6 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Mushrooms, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      3 tb White wine
      3 tb Lemon juice
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 c  Ham, cooked, finely chopped
      1 tb Parsley, chopped
      Trim tops and leaves of artichokes with scissors and cut stalks level
  with base.  (I would cut off the top third of the artichoke and cut off the
  tips of the leaves remaining to remove "spikes".) Put artichokes into a
  kettle of boiling salted water and simmer about 35 to 40 minutes or until a
  leaf can be pulled out easily. Drain, refresh under cold running water, and
  let stand upside down until cool.
      To make the dressing:  Saute green onions slowly in 2 tablespoons of
  the oil, until just tender.  Stir in mushrooms and cook 2-3 minutes; then
  stir in bread crumbs and cheese.  Transfer mixture to a bowl and let stand
  until cool.  Stir in wine, lemon juice and remaining oil. Season well with
  garlic salt, salt and pepper, then add ham.
      Prepare each artichoke by pulling out some of the center leaves until
  the choke can be reached.  (I'd just cut off about the top third of the
  artichoke and the choke would be reachable.)  With a teaspoon, scrape out
  all the hairy choke.  Fill each artichoke with dressing and top with
  parsley.  Wrap each artichoke in foil, leaving the top open. Place on
  smoker grid and smoke for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

   Servings: 48
------------------------PHYLLO TART SHELLS-----------------------------
      1 lg Egg white
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
-----------------------SMOKED TROUT FILLING----------------------------
      2 pk Cream cheese, low-fat (8 oz)
    1/2 lb Trout fillets; smoked, skin
           --and pin bones removed
    1/3 c  Scallions; chopped (2 scall
      4 ts Horseradish; well drained
      1 c  Cucumber; shredded
      To make phyllo tartlet shells: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly
  coat 2 mini-muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, whisk
  together egg white, oil and salt.
      Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface and with a pastry brush,
  lightly coat it with the egg-white mixture. Lay a second sheet smoothly on
  top, taking care to line up the edges before setting the sheet down. (Once
  you set down the sheet, it cannot be moved.) Brush with the egg-white
  mixture and repeat with 1 more sheet. Lay a fourth sheet on top but do not
  brush it.
      With a knife, cut the dough into 4 strips lenghtwise and 5 strips
  crosswise, making 24 squares. Press squares into muffin cups and bake for 8
  to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Transfer the tartlets to a
  rack and let cool. Repeat the procedure with the remaining 4 sheets of
  phyllo and egg-white mixture. (The baked tartlet shells may be stored in a
  closed container at room temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to
  2 months.)
       To make smoked trout filling: In a food processor, combine cream
  cheese and smoked trout; process until fairly smooth. Add scallions and
  horseradish and pulse until just combined. (Alternatively, finely mince the
  smoked trout with a knife and combine with the cream cheese, scallion and
  horseradish in a small bowl.) (The smoked filling may be made ahead and
  refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Shortly before serving, spoon or pipe about
  1 heaping tsp. of filling into each tartlet shell and garnish with shredded
  cucumber.

  Any number of smoked fish can be used in this simple recipe. Instead of a

  bread.

  gradually, then melted butter.  Beat egg whites stiff.  Fold into crepe
  mixture.  They either may be cooked in the usual way in a crepe pan or put
  into a large buttered pan and baked in a preheated 375F oven for about 25
  to 30 minutes.  This then becomes something like a flat souffle that can be
  topped with a filling or one can be put over half the batter, the rest
  poured on top.  It can be a sweet filling like strawberries or apples and
  may be flavored with lemon rind, brandy, or vanilla.

      Title: Sour Cream Brittlebread
 Categories: Appetizers
   Servings:  6
  1 1/3 c  Flour
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt (optional, see note*)
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sour cream or soured milk**
      1 tb Seasoned salt (optional)
           Kosher salt for sprinkling
  * Leave out the first salt if using seasoned salt ** (My note) works OK
  with 1/2 tb lemon juice in milk thickened with extra milk powder to make
  1/2 cup. Sprinkled salt did not stick very well, suggest mixing in the
  desired amount of regular salt. Spices may mix more evenly if combined
  first with the flour.
  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, salt and baking
  soda into a bowl or food processor.  Cut in the butter.  Add the sour ceam
  and salt or seasoning.  Mix to a soft dough.
  Roll out PAPER-THIN on a floured board.  Cut in 1 1/2" squares or shapes
  and sprinkle with salt (see note).  Bake on ungreased baking sheet about 5
  min.  Remove the thin pieces that brown first if necessary and give the
  other pieces a bit longer to brown. Turn off heat and crisp in the oven.
  Makes about 3 small cookie sheets of "crackers" almost touching or may be
  cooked in larger sheets to break up after cooking.  May be rolled between
  sheets of wax paper 1/4 to 1/2 of the dough at a time.
  Keep for snacking in an air tight jar. Suggestion - divide the dough and
  the spices in thirds.  Mix and bake the first pan and taste so that
  seasoning or salt can be adjusted.  OR make some spicy and some just salted
  and cut them different shapes so you know which are which.

-----------------------SPINACH-FETA FILLING----------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Spinach; fresh, stemmed and
           --washed
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 bn Scallions, trimmed and
           --chopped (1-1/2 c)
    1/4 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
      2 tb Parmesan cheese, freshly
           --grated
      2 tb Dill; fresh, chopped
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Salt & pepper, to taste
      2 lg Egg whites
--------------------------PHYLLO PASTRY-------------------------------
      8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18")
      1 lg Egg white
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Poppy or sesame seeds, or a
           --combination
     To make filling: Put spinach with water still clinging to the leaves in
  a large pot. Cover and cook over medium heat until the spinach is wilted,
  about 5 minutes. Drain and refresh with cold water. Squeeze the spinach
  quite dry and chop. In nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add
  scallions and saute until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a
  medium-sized bowl and stir in spinach, feta, Parmesan, dill and lemon
  juice. Season with salt and pepper. Beat egg whites lightly with a fork and
  stir into the spinach mixture.
      To form phyllo rolls: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 350
  degrees F. Coat a baking sheet lightly with nonstick cooking spray or line
  with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and
  salt. Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
  you. Brush lower half of the sheet with the egg-white mixture. Repeat this
  step with a second sheet of phyllo and set on top of the first. Spoon
  one-quarter of the spinach filling along one long edge. Tuck in the side
  edges and roll up, jelly-roll fashion. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
  Repeat with the remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling, making 4
  rolls in all. Brush tops of the rolls lightly with the egg-mixture and
  sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. With a serrated
  knife, cut each roll diagonally into 9 pieces and serve hot.
  The rolls may be prepared, baked and sliced up to 2 days in advance. Reheat
  in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated through. Makes
  36 appetizers.

      4 tb Parmesan, fresh grated
      1    Egg yolk
      3 tb Olive oil (extra virgin is
           - best)
      Preheat oven to 450F.  Trim off the ends of each zucchini.  Cut each in
  half crosswise.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the centers,
  leaving a shell at least 1/4-inch thick.  Reserve and finely chop the
  scooped-out portions.  There should be about 1-1/2 cups. Pour enough water
  to cover the shells into a saucepan and boil.
   Add the shells and simmer 2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly.  Clean and finely
  chop mushrooms.  There should be about 2 cups.  Heat butter in heavy
  skillet and add onions and garlic.  Cook briefly, stirring, and add
  mushrooms and lemon juice.  Stir and cook one minute.  Add the chopped
  zucchini, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cook about 3 minutes until the excess
  moisture evaporates.
      Spoon and scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and let cool slightly.
  Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs, the parsley, 2 tablespoons of the cheese and
  blend thoroughly.  Stir in the egg yolk.
      With 1 tablespoon of the oil, brush the inside of a baking dish big
  enough to hold the shells in one layer.  Spoon an equal portion of the
  filling into each shell and smooth over the top.  Blend the remaining 2
  tablespoons bread crumbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons cheese and
  sprinkle over the top of the stuffed zucchini boats. Sprinkle evenly with
  the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
      Place the dish in the oven and bake 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.

      Title: Sun Dried Tomato Dip
 Categories: Dips, Appetizers, Microwave
   Servings:  1
    1/2 lb Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Dry
           (Not In Oil)
      2 c  Water
     10 md Cloves Garlic, Peeled
  1 1/2 ts Oregano, Dried
  1 1/2 ts Thyme, Dried
  1 1/4 c  Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
  MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD: Combine tomatoes, water, garlic, oregano and thyme
  in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish.  Cover tightly with microwave
  plastic wrap. Cook at 100% in a high-wattage oven for 8 minutes. Prick
  plastic to release steam. Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well.
  Re-cover and cook for 8 minutes longer.  Prick plastic to release steam.
  Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well and allow to stand, stirring
  occasionally, until cool and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Transfer
  to a 1-1/2-quart souffle dish.  Pour 3/4 cup of the olive oil and the
  vegetable oil over the tomato mixture. Cover tightly with microwave plastic
  wrap and cook for 5 minutes.  Prick plastic to release steam. Remove from
  oven and uncover.  Stir and allow to stand until cool. Transfer to the work
  bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Scrape into a large bowl
  and stir in remaining olive oil if serving immediately. Otherwise, pack in
  a refrigerator storage container with a tightly fitting lid. The dip will
  keep as long as a month, so think about making the whole quantity.
  STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes with water in nonreactive
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over med heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to a
  simmer and cook, covered, for 22 minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Cook with
  oil, garlic, oregano and thyme over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes.
  Puree. Above makes 3 cups. Author's note: The sun-dried tomato dip is a
  real breakthrough.  At a recent cocktail party, 7 guests demanded the
  recipe. Buying sun-dried tomatoes dry in bulk instead of packed in oil
  makes them less expensive. Reviving them in the microwave means that you
  can use a minimum of liquid for optimum intensity of flavor. Then they be
  packed up in good quality olive oil (much better than that which comes with
  them in jars) to use as needed or to turn into this dip, with its rich,
  mystifying flavor.  The dip keeps for weeks in the refrigerator. You will
  want to have the ubiquitous sliced raw vegetables; fennel does well with
  this dip. You don't have to use a microwave oven; you can still make this
  dip even if it is slightly less intense in flavor. The reward is the
  cooking water. Save it to use for boiling pasta. Cooked either way, this
  dip makes a delicious pasta sauce. Below are timings for other amounts of
  sun-dried tomatoes so that you can multiply and divide the recipe as you
  want.  Almost every informal party requires at least one dip. Allow 1/4 cup
  per guest.  At bigger parties, I often supply two or three, spacing them
  around the room(s) with dippers at each location. MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD:
  FOR 1/4 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 1 cup water in a 2-1/2 quart souffle
  dish, cook, covered, at 100% in a high-wattage oven 5 minutes; prick
  plastic to release steam; stir; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. In a
  low-wattage oven, cook 9 minutes and 9 minutes. FOR 1/2 POUND DRIED
  TOMATOES: With 2 cups water in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish,
  cook in a high-wattage oven 8 minutes, then 8 minutes. In a low-wattage
  oven, cook 12 minutes and 14 minutes. FOR 1 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 4
  cups water in a 5-quart casserole, cook in a high-wattage oven 14 minutes,
  then 14 minutes.  In a low-wattage oven, cook 20 minutes and 20 minutes.
  STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes with water in a nonreactive
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to
  a simmer and cook, covered, for 22 minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Recipe

  *DIRECTIONS*
  BLANCHING TECHNIQUE: Bring 1-quart of water to boil. Submerge tomatoes in
  boiling water for 3 minutes to reconstitute. Take 4 aside and cut into
  strips.
  In a food processor, combine cream cheese, butter, Parmesan, olive oil and
  remaining sun-dried tomatoes.  Process until smooth. Place in refrigerator
  for about 30 minutes, or until firm enough to shape into a ball. Place
  cheese ball on a platter. Arrange basil leaves and reserved tomato strips
  around cheese ball like a sunburst. To serve, spread on your favorite
  crackers.
  Makes 2-1/2 cups.
  Recipe from Melissa's brand Sun-dried Tomatoes.
  This recipe was called "Dried Tomato Dip" but I sure didn't see it as a dip
  so I renamed it.  I guess it could be a spread, but sure can't see
  "dipping" anything into this as it would be too stiff.

 Categories: Appetizers, Beef, Entertain
   Servings:  4
      1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver
      2 tb Salad Oil
      3 tb Butter
      1 lg Spanish Onion, Chopped
      1    Egg, Hard-Cooked, Mashed
           Salt
           Freshly Ground Pepper
  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a heavy
  skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high heat until
  translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
  Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium
  heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively,
  liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a
  piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60
  seconds. Overcooking causes the liver to be dry and tough. For finely
  mashed egg that disappears in the liver mixture, force egg through a wire
  strainer. For best results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and
  sieve them separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and
  place cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
  the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat
  and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper. Taste and
  adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial gravy browning
  liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve
  with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye bread. By Sur Le Gril's chef

  limp.  Pour off liquid and coarsely chop.  When water is cooked out of
  onions, add 1 teaspoon of flour and stir to dissolve.
  Remove from heat and add 2 egg yolks and cream with the onions. Stir
  constantly.
  PIE PASTRY: Sift flour onto a pastry board, cloth or dough bowl and make a
  large well in the center. Pound butter to soften slightly or have at room
  temperature.  Place butter, egg yolks, salt and smaller amount of water in
  the well and work together with the fingertips of one hand until partly
  mixed.  Gradually work in flour, pulling dough into large crumbs using the
  fingertips of both hands.  If the crumbs are dry, sprinkle over a
  tablespoon of more water.  Press dough firmly together - it should be soft,
  but not sticky.  Work on a lightly floured board, pushing dough away with
  the heel of the hand and gathering it up with a dough scraper until smooth
  and pliable.  Press dough into a ball. Wrap in foil or plastic wrap and
  chill for 30 minutes. It can be stored tightly wrapped in the refrigerator
  for up to 3 days.
  DIRECTIONS: Roll pastry to about 1/2 inch thickness in a rectangular shape.
  Place pastry on an oiled baking sheet. Crimp edges of pastry if desired.
  Beat an egg yolk with a pinch of salt and brush over the entire pastry.
  This is called "egg glazing" and helps the filling adhere to the pastry.
  Pierce pastry with a fork in several places to prevent bubbles from forming
  while baking. Spread onion mixture over the pastry and sprinkle the chopped
  bacon on top. Bake at 300 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until nicely
  borwned. Cut into 1 inch squares for hors d'oeuvres. May be made a day
  ahead and reheated. Wait to cut until after heating if made ahead. May be
  baked in individual tartlet pans or a pie plate. From "Sweet Vidalia
