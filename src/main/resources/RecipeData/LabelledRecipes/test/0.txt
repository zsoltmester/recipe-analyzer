To make the dough: place the flour and salt   in a large bowl; mix well.  Cut the shortening into small pieces about the   size of walnuts.  Add to the flour and, using your fingers, rub the flour   and shortening together, making a coarse, mealy dough.  Add the ice water   and gather the dough into a ball.  The dough should be firm and not sticky.   If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, but if the dough is too   sticky, add just enough flour to make it form a ball. Divide the dough into   2 equal balls and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours   or up to 2 days.

Place about 1 tablespoon of filling on one side of each   circle, leaving a 1/4 inch border.  Fold the dough over, making a half-moon   shape.  Seal the edges with the tines of a fork, and brush with the   remaining egg.      Bake on a lightly greased baking sheet for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the   patties are golden brown.

Chill until set.      I used walnuts, because I had them on hand, and this turned out fine.  I   served it alongside thinly sliced toasted rounds of italian bread. Yum.   Next to that, I had a wedge of brie surrounded by bite-sized hunks of   carrots (cutting veggies to bite size saves the worry some people have   about others who dip, bite, then stick something bitten back into the dip.   . .) and a dip I make for veggies that is yummy, but not for the faint of   heart.      Spicy Yogurt Dip      1 c nonfat yogurt 1 1/2 Tbsp apricot honey (or 1 Tbsp honey plus 1/2 Tbsp   apricot preserves) 1 tsp curry powder 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper      Mix all ingredients together and let sit for at least an hour.  The flavor   intensifies, but you may want to add curry and/or cayenne later. This   tastes sweet, and you don't realize it's hot until it's too late.

Press all the dough   together into a ball then, finally, work it thoroughly with the heel of   your hand, gathering it up with pastry scraper as you do so until it is   soft and pliable. Leave it in the refrigerator to firm up again before you   roll it out.      Filling      Peel the onions. Cut them into fine rings and weigh out 300 g.      Cook the bacon strips (which need to be VERY finely cut) in the butter. Let   them take on a golden colour, then add the sliced onions and leave them to   cook gently until they are tender.      In a bowl beat together the cream, milk and eggs, adding salt, pepper and   nutmeg to taste.      When the onions are cooked, add them to the mixture in the bowl and add the   chopped parsley.      Preparation      Roll out the dough 2mm thick and use it to line a buttered tart tin 26 cm   in diameter and at least 3cm deep. Cut a disc of aluminium foil of the same   diameter as the tin and place it on the pastry. Weight it down with a   handful of beans or crusts.      Pre-heat the oven to 150 oC (300 oF) and cook the pastry 'blind' for half   an hour. Watch the coulouring of the edge and as soon as it starts to turn   golden remove the aluminium foil and beans or crusts. Cook the pastry shell   until the base is baked but not coloured.      Fill the shell with the onion mixture. Put the tart back into the oven.   Check that the temperature is still 150 oC and keep the oven at or just   below this temperature for about 1 hour. Towards the end you could reduce   the heat a little, as the tart needs TO COOK VERY SLOWLY. The tart is ready   if, when you shake it, the filling appears to be quite firm with no hint of   a whole in the centre.      Serve warm, in small slices !

Simmer the mushroom caps for 6 mintues, transfer tham to paper   towels, and let them drain. (Blanching the mushroom caps will prevent them   from wrinkling while they are baking.) In a skillet, cook the bacon over   moderate heat until it is crisp, transfer it to paper towels, and let it   drain.  Pour off all but 1-1/2 tbsp of the fat from the skillet, in the   remaining fat cook the onion, the garlic, and the mushroom stems over   moderately low heat,stirring, until the vegetables are softened, and add   the soy sauce, the sesame seeds, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, the bacon,   crumbled, and pepper to taste. Cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minutes,   or until it is slightly dry, divide it among the mushroom caps, mounding   it, and transfer the stuffed mushrooms to a jelly-roll pan. The mushrooms   may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered tightly   with plastic wrap and chilled.  Sprinkle the remaining 1 tbsp bread crumbs   over the mushrooms and bake the mushrooms in the middle of a preheated 325   F oven for 7 minutes, or until the filling is heated through. To make the   filling crisper, the cooked mushrooms may be put under a preheated broiler   about 4 inches from the heat for 1 minute. Garnish the mushrooms with the   scallion.

You can prepare the oysters   and sauce ahead in the microwave, and then broil for a minute or two just   before serving.  The obvious wine to serve is Champagne. If you choose   another dry sparkling wine to drink instead, use the same one in the sauce.      Recipe from Barbara Kafka, Cook's Magazine, September/October, 1987.

See end of recipe for related info.   Cut the fish into long strips; the shrimp and scallops can remain whole.   Put the seafood, jalapenos and cilantro through a coarse blade of a meat   grinder.  Combine the ground seafood with the egg whites, lemon juice,   cumin, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Rinse the hog casing in cold water   by letting the water run from the tap directly through it.  (The casing   should not have any holes.)  Gather the casing up onto the sauce stuffing   funnel attachment on your meat grinder. Put the seafood mixture back in the   grinder and begin to grind it through. When it begins to emerge from the   funnel, tie the end of the casing in a knot, leaving 3 inches of it   unfilled for expansion room.  Grind the mixture out, taking care not to   overstuff the length of sausage; it should be about 1 inch wide.  If   necessary, squeeze it gently with your hands to make this width as you   work.  Continue with the entire length; you will have about 4 feet of   sausage. Remove the funnel and use your finger to press out the last   remaining seafood mixture.  Leave 3 inches for expansion and tie the end in   a knot. Shape to make it even.  Coil it into a spiral and set it aside.   Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a large heavy skillet with a lid. Reduce   the heat so that the water barely quivers.  Prick the sausage with a sharp   knife pint at 3-inch intervals.  Place it in the barely moving water, cover   the pan and cook for 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let the sausage   rest for 10 minutes before serving. NOTE: If you use kitchen parchment,   butter the paper and place 1/2 cup of the mixture on each piece.

For appetizers with a lot of style but little fat, phyllo pastries are a   natural. The paper-thin sheets of phyllo dough can be rolled, folded,   shaped, seasoned, or filled in countless ways. In typical phyllo recipes,   however, the layers of dough are freely brushed with melted butter; when   baked, the butter keeps the thin sheets separate, producing a flaky--and   fat-saturated--result. We developed a technique in which the leaves of   phyllo are lightly coated with a blend of egg white and olive oil. During   baking, the egg whites become crisp while the oil keeps the leaves   separate. The low-fat technique has an unexpected and welcome benefit: the   pastries turn out crisper and less oily than those made with pure fat, and   filled pastires don't become soggy.      Frozen phyllo (or filo or fillo) is available in most supermarkets; it is   also sold fresh in some Greek and Middle Eastern specialty shops. One pound   of dough averages 25 large sheets of pastry. Our recipes were devloped for   full-sized sheets, either 14 by 18 inches or 12 by 17 inches. These   appetizers work beautifully for entertaining because they can be prepared   in advance and refrigerated or frozen.      TIPS:      Phyllo Dough is easy and fun to work with as long as it doesn't get soggy   or dried out. To avoid these potential hazards:         Thaw frozen phyllo in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or   overnight; this will prevent damp spots that could cause the sheets of   dough to stick together.         Remove phyllo from refrigerator, and leave unopened at room temperature   for 1 to 2 hours.         Clear a large work surface before removing phyllo from the box.         Carefully unroll sheets onto a dry surface.         Keep sheets of phyllo covered with plastic wrap or wax paper while you   work; if the dough is left uncovered for even a short period of time, it   dries out and breaks into flakes.         Work quickly and with a gentle hand.      From Eating Well, May/June 1993.
