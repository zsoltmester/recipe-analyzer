Add salt to eggs,add eggs   to flour. mix with your hands until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl.   It should be fairly stiff. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. Roll   out on a lightly floured board (or on a white cloth). Roll and stretch   until it is paper thin...well very thin. Cut into 3" squares. Place one T   of filling in center of each square and fold to make a triangle. Crimp   edges with a fork and cook in boiling water. If you have a pasta machine   (or I sometimes use FP go for it. Cook until they rise to the top; about 10   or 12 minutes. DO NOT COOK IN THE SOUP. You may warm them in the soup.    FILLINGS. These days I zap all the ingredients for each type of filling in   the FP...leaving the eggs for last. For the cheese filling, you just want   to combine.

Mix together the ingredients for the mice bodies and shape into 4 little   mice shaped loafs on baking sheet. Have them shaped to a point in the front   and rounded in the back. Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven or until   desired doneness. Take and cut little slits for the ears about 1/3 from the   pointed end. Place the carrot coins in the slits for the ears. Make a tiny   slit in the rounded wide end for the tail and place one of the carrot   strips in the slit for the tail. Use the raisins for the eyes. Break the   uncooked spaghetti noodles into pieces and place around the "nose" (pointed   end) for whiskers. Heat the spaghetti sauce. Place a large spoonful of   sauce on a plate. Place a meatloaf mouse on top of the spaghetti sauce to   serve.      Stolen from someone on Prodigy.  
1/4 c  Water       1 c  Sugar (white granulated)       1 c  Vinegar (white)       1 ts Salt     1/4 lb Dried shrimp (Kung Haeng)       8 ea Serrano chilies       1 bn Green onions (whites only)       8 oz Tofu, firm or extra firm       3 ea Eggs       2 c  Vegetable oil (approx. amnt)     1/4 lb Rice noodles (very thin)     1.  Combine the water, sugar, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring   the mixture to a gentle boil and cook about ten minutes, until it forms a   thin syrup.  Set aside.      2.  Put the dried shrimp in a sieve and rinse them thoroughly under running   water.  Set them aside in the sieve to drain.  Remove the stems, but not   the seeds, from the chilies.  Slice the green onions and chilies lengthwise   into thin strips and set them aside together.      3.  Slice the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside.  Beat the eggs   lightly, until they are well mixed but not frothy.  Strain through a fine   sieve and set aside.      4.  Pour about three inches of oil in a wok and heat it to 400 degrees F.   Dry the tofu with paper towels and deep fry it until the cubes are firm and   light golden, but not dry and hard.  Remove them from the oil and set aside   to drain on paper towels.      5.  Using the same oil, deep fry the noodles a handful at a time.  The   noodles will puff up immediately and begin to turn brown in about ten   seconds.  (Note: these are the same type of noodles that are used to make   chinese chicken salad.)  Be careful not to let them burn.  They should be   light golden and very puffy.  If they do not expand immediately upon   touching the oil, the oil is not hot enough.  If they turn dark   immediately, the oil is too hot.  Scoop the noodles out to drain on paper   towels.  Remove about half the oil from the wok and save it for another   use.      6.  Dribble the beaten, sieved eggs over the surface of the hot oil in the   wok, to form narrow strands: holding the bowl of eggs in one hand, dip the   other into the eggs, stretch it out about 12 inches over the oil, and let   the egg run in a thin, steady stream from your fingertips while moving your   hand in a circular motion so the surface of the oil is covered wit a thin   net of egg.  You will need to repeat this procedure about four times. The   intent is to create a thin net of egg strands that will cook quickly   without massing together.  When the strands are set completely and light   golden on the bottom, flip them over carefully and brown the other side.   Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.      7.  Dry the shrimp thoroughly with paper towels.  Using the same oil, deep   fry the shrimp until they are just crisp and light golden, about three   minutes.  Be prepared for the very strong smell they produce as they fry,   but don't be concerned, since the shrimp will taste nothing like they   smell.  (You may wish to do this well in advance of the time your guests   will arrive and set the shrimp aside to drain on paper towels.)  They will   form a great deal of foam while they are frying, and it will be necessary   to use a strainer to lift them up occasionally to see how well they are   cooking.  Do not over cook them or let them get dry or hard!  Remove them   from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Discard the remaining oil.      8.  Clean the wok thoroughly and place half the sugar syrup from step 1 in   it.  Heat the syrup almost to boiling, but do not let it boil.  Add half   the noodles, half the egg nets (see the variation below), half the tofu,   and half the shrimp.  Mix gently until the syrup is absorbed, being careful   to break the noodles as little as possible.  Remove the mixture from the   wok and place it on a serving platter.  Repeat this step with the rest of   the syrup, noodles, eggs, and shrimp.      9.  Garnish the Mee Krob with the green onion whites and chilies.  Serve   immediately or hold it at room temperature for up to two hours.      VARIATION:  If the eggs have formed attractive nets (you should be so   lucky!), you may drape them over the Mee Krob as a garnish rather than   adding them in step 8.

Drain. Toss all ingredients together and marinate   for at least 1 hour. Serve on a bed of lettuce.      Other tips:      I used 3.5 oz of noodles, and less dressing. The chili makes it hot so if   you don't like spicy, it would be fine to leave it out. You may want to   break the noodles a little before cooking (but not too much). I made the   mistake of not breaking them and ended up having to cut them a little in   order to get my ingredients to combine properly.      This salad is even better the next day. I imagine it travels nicely because   it isn't too soupy.

Drain and rinse in   cold water. Drain thoroughly, and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. (My   advice, store in water if not using right away!) 2) Add vinegar, sugar, soy   sauce, salt, and sesame seeds. Mix well. Cover and chill until cold. (Don't   chill for too long or the noodles will stick together. I did this but was   able to save it by adding more rice vinegar until the noodles separated   again. It tasted great.) 3) Peel adn seed the cucumber. Cut into quarters   lengthwise, then into thin pieces. If not serving right away, wrap the   cucumber pieces in a plastic bag or plastic wrap and refrigerate. 4) To   serve, divide the noodles amon 4 or 5 serving bowls. Top with a small   handful of cucumber slices, a light sprinkling of sesame seeds, and , if   desired, a few very thin slices of scallion greens. Serve cold.      This salad is subtle adn very refreshing. There is a variety of   textures-chewy cold noodles (bean thread noodles, some call them cellophane   noodles 'cause when you boil them they become clear), crunchy sesame seeds,   and smooth cucumber slices. Sweet, salt, and vinegar combine harmoniously,   each understated but very much present.      Everything except the cucumbers and toppings can be combined several days   ahead of time. (I beg to differ on this claim because, if you don't keep   the boiled noodles in cold water while setting them aside, they will stick   together.)

Place a small amount of the bean   mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish.  Layer four or   five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra length of noodle and save   for the next noodle layer).  Spread 1/2 of the bean/salsa mix on top of   noodles then top with 1/2 the cottage cheese and some of the cheddar. Top   with more noodles then the remaining bean/salsa mix and cottage cheese. top   with more cheddar and remaining noodles.  Top with a little more cheddar.   Bake in microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for   30 minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly).      This was really good and alot easier than it sounds.

You want the beans to be almost but   not quite pourable. Mix the rest of the taco sauce and tomato juice and set   aside.      Put about a quarter of the taco sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13"   lasagne pan. Cover sauce with a layer of noodles. Layer, in any order you   want, the beans, corn, cheese, drained tomatoes, sauce and noodles, being   sure to end up with enough beans to cover the top with no noodles showing.   The resulting mess should be pretty wet.      Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 for about an hour, until the noodles   are tender. Check every 5-10 minutes after 45 minutes of cooking to see how   the noodles are doing. Remove foil, sprinkle with olives. Bake another   couple of minutes. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.      Serves 3-4 as a main dish. Tastes even better the next day.      Variation: If you want to pre-cook the noodles, don't use as much tomato   juice and cook for only about 30 minutes.      Variation: Other veggies would work well in here too. What do you have in   the frig?      Variation: You could top it with a little ff cheese-stuff in the last few   minutes.

Add   remaining ingredients, except for the noodles. Simmer over low heat 15   minutes, add noodles, and cook an additional 10 minutes. Serve hot.

Drain well, and set aside.   Sauti onion and green pepper in butter in a Dutch oven until tender; add   flour, stirring until smooth.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.   Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until   thickened and bubbly.  Stir in noodles, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, poppy   seeds, salt, red pepper, and tofu; add pimiento, and stir gently. Spoon   mixture into a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish. Cover and   chill 8 hours.  To bake, remove from refrigerator, and let stand at room   temperature 30 min.  Bake, covered, at 350 for 45 min.  Uncover, and   sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese.  Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 min.   or until thoroughly heated.      1. I use one pound of tofu cut into 1 inch squares instead of turkey.  (I   am a vegitarian.)      2. It does not have to refrigerate, but the tastes do mingle better if it   does.      3. I usually sprinkle more than 2 tablespoons of cheese on top.

Each   stall serves a specialty, typically an honest, unpretentious,   home-style dish for $1 to $3 a plate.    This rice noodle dish is hawker food at its best.  If done right, its   fragrance will tell you how good it's going to be as soon as it   arrives at your table.  Singapore hawkers will use whatever seafoods   are available, including cockles and sliced fish cakes in addition to   those suggested in this recipe.  Feel free to experiment.    1.  Steam the sausages for 10 minutes.  Cut them in thin diagonal   slices. Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Let them   stand for 10 minutes, rinse well with cold water, drain, and pat dry.   Cut the squid into 1/4 inch rings and tentacles.  Cut the barbecued   pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Combine the white pepper, soy   sauces, and oyster sauce in a bowl; set aside.    2.  Just before cooking, put the noodles in a large bowl and pour   boiling water over them.  Stir gently with chopsticks to separate the   strands, drain, and shake off the excess water.    3.  Preheat a wok; when hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the   remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the garlic, shallots, and chiles and   cook over medium-high heat until the garlic is golden brown.   Increase the heat to high and toss in the shrimp and squid; stirfry   until the shrimp turn bright orange and the squid looks opaque white,   about 2 minutes. Add the sausage slices, barbecued pork, bean   sprouts, and cabbage; toss and stir until the vegetables begin to   wilt.  Remove everything in the wok to a platter and set aside.    4.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the wok; when hot,   toss in the well-drained noodles.  Gently toss and flip the noodles   to heat them through.  Be careful not to break them; it is okay if   they brown slightly. Push the noodles up the sides of the wok to make   a well in the middle; pour in the soy sauce mixture, then toss the   noodles gently to sauce them evenly.  Make a well again and break the   eggs into the middle. Without mixing them with the noodles, scramble   the eggs lightly. When the eggs begin to set, add the green onions   and return the seafood mixture. Gently toss together to reheat and   mix.  Serve hot, with a hot chill sauce for seasoning to taste.   Garnish with coriander sprigs.    NOTE:  Both here and in Asia, fresh rice noodles are usually   purchased rather than made at home.  Look for them in Asian markets   or Chinese take-out dim sum shops.  This dish can be prepared with   dried rice noodles; however, it is worth taking the time to seek out   the fresh variety.    Make certain that your wok is well seasoned or the fragile rice   noodles will break apart and stick to the pan.  Although I hesitate   recommending that you cook with a non stick wok or skillet, they will   work fine if you are more comfortable with them.    TECHNIQUE NOTE; To clean squid, start by separating all the   tentacles from the heads, cutting across as close as possible to the   eyes.  Squeeze out and discard the hard, pea sized beak in the center   of each cluster of tentacles.  Rinse the tentacles and drain them in   a colander. Grasp the mantle (the saclike "body" of the squid) in one   hand and the head in the other and pull apart; the entrails will pull   out attached to the head. Pull the transparent quill out of each   mantle.  Discard everything but the tentacles and mantles.  Running a   little water into each mantle to open it up, reach in with a finger   and pull out any entrails remaining inside. (Working over a second   colander to catch all the debris will make cleanup easier.) You can   remove the spotted outer skin or leave it on (I prefer to remove it).   Transfer the cleaned mantles to a cutting board, slice them crosswise   to the desired size,and add them to the tentacles in the colander.   Give everything another rinse and drain thoroughly.              2    Chinese sausages (lop            -cheong)     1/4 lb Medium shrimp (36 to 40 per            -pound), shelled and            -deveined       1 ts Salt     1/4 lb Cleaned squid, with            -tentacles (See Technique            -Note)     1/4 lb Chinese barbecued pork     1/4 ts White pepper   1 1/2 tb Dark soy sauce   1 1/2 tb Light soy sauce       1 tb Oyster sauce       2 lb Fresh rice noodles, in            -5/8-inch-wide strips       4 tb Peanut oil       4    Cloves garlic, chopped       4    Shallots, sliced (1/2 cup            -sliced)       6    Fresh red chiles, seeded            -and chopped       1 c  Bean sprouts, tails removed       1 c  Shredded Chinese cabbage       2 lg Eggs       4    Green onions, chopped            Fresh coriander sprigs, for            -garnish      Nothing is more fascinating and delicious than eating at the open-   air street hawker centers in Asia, particularly in Singapore.

10 sm Black dried mushrooms     1/2 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles            -(regular mein)            Sesame oil     1/2 lb Sea scallops            Cornstarch     1/2 lb Flank steak       2 ts Dark soy sauce     1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced       1 lb Bok choy, cut in 1 1/2-inch            -lengths       2    Eggs   2 1/4 c  Fresh chicken stock       2 tb Light soy sauce            Salt     1/2 ts Sugar            Peanut oil       1 tb Or more dry sherry or            -Shaoxing rice wine     Here's a recipe for Chow Mein which is a pretty classic application   using pan fried noodles.      Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them.   Let soak for 30 minutes.      Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large quantity of boiling water for   3 1/2 to 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, drain again, toss   with a little sesame oil and set aside.      Cut The scallops in half, toss with a little sesame oil and 1 1/2   teaspoons of cornstarch; refrigerate.  Cut the flank steak as thinly   as possible across the grain.  Toss with 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch,   in a little sesame oil and the dark soy sauce; set aside.  When the   mushrooms have soaked, squeeze them out over the soaking liquid, and   reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid.  Cut off the mushroom stems and   discard; cut the caps in two and set aside with the bamboo shoots and   bok choy.      Lightly beat the eggs with a few drops of sesame oil.  Heat a small   frying pan and oil the bottom lightly.  Pour in enough of the beaten   egg to cover the bottom, pouring any excess back into the uncooked   eggs. Cook just until set and remove.  Repeat until all the egg is   used up. Stack the egg crepes, roll them up and slice across the roll   into shreds. Set aside.      Mix the chicken stock with the light soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt   and the sugar; set aside.  Heat this mixture in a small pot over low   heat.      Meanwhile, heat a wok over medium high heat until hot.  Add 1 cup   peanut oil and heat until the oil is very hot.  Lower the noodles   into the oil to form a nest and let them cook until brown on one   side.  (This may take 8 minutes or so.) Turn the noodles over and   brown on the other side. (This will be much faster.) Remove to a   large serving platter and keep warm.      Cook the scallops very briefly in the same oil, remove and drain in a   colander.  Turn the heat off under the oil and add the beef.  Stir   just until the meat slices are separated and start to change color.   Remove to drain with the scallops.      Pour off all the oil but 1/4 cup and heat.  Add the vegetables and   stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the seasoned stock and bring to a   boil. Mix the reserved mushroom soaking liquid with 2 tablespoons of   cornstarch until dissolved and stir into the chicken stock sauce.   Stir until it thickens and clears slightly.  Add the beef and   scallops, then the wine and cook just until heated through.  Pour   over the noodles and serve garnished with the egg shreds.      Posted by Stephen Ceideburg December 18 1990.

These triangular little goodies are   great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!   Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.      Set aside.      Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.   Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.      Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and   dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with   only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a   barely damp cloth to prevent curling.      Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread   flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it   out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become   pliable within seconds.      Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the   filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in   the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.   Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press   into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it   is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely   and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold   the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed   roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers   in the same manner.      Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2   inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.   Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will   stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning   often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.   Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.      Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and   coriander leaves.      NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F   oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.

The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first   one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.   Set aside.      Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water   until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the   mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.   Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a   large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.      Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and   dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must   be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for   handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep   golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with   only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets   covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,   immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat   on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice   paper will become pliable within seconds.      Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of   filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a   compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then   the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the   filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.      Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2   inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in   batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or   let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat   for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove   the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low   oven while frying the remaining rolls.      Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in   this recipe.      To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few   strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the   Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as   an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a   main course.      NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the   noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the   individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground   roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.      As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc   Cham.              8 oz Thin rice vermicelli            -vermicelli (bun) or       2 bn Of Japanese alimentary            -paste noodles (somen).

The rice paper   will become pliable within seconds.      Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of   filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press it into a   compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then   the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely   enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.  (The   rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)      Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches   of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in batches, add   some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick   together. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and   crisp.  Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper   towels.  Keep warm in a low oven until all of th rolls are cooked.      To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some   noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the   package in the dipping sauce.      NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a   350F oven just to crisp and heat through.         From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier.

1 lb Prawns       5    Coriander roots, crushed       1 tb Pepper corns       1    Onion, thinly sliced       3 sl Ginger, crushed       2 tb Cooking oil       1 tb Maggi sauce     1/4 ts Salt       1 tb Sugar       1 tb Oyster sauce       2 tb Light soy sauce       1 ts Sesame oil       1 tb Whiskey       2 c  Mungbean noodles, soaked            -and cut into short lengths     Here's a goody that came out of my new Thai cookbook.  It's easy and   quick to do and quite tasty.  It's a baked dish, which is unusual for   Thai cooking.  I suspect that originally, it would have been steamed.   Next time I'll try it that way or put a tablespoon of water or sherry   in each bowl. It seemed a tad dry to me.  I cooked it in individual   French onion soup bowls with lids.      Place the oil in a wok, heat and stir fry the coriander root, ginger,   pepper and onion.  When fragrant, remove from the wok and place in a   mixing bowl.      Add the noodles, the sauces. salt, sugar, sesame oil and whiskey,   toss the noodles until well coated, and then add the prawns and toss   well once again.      Divide the noodles and prawns into four individual portions; place   each portion in a lidded cup, and close the lids.  Place the cups on   a baking tray and bake at 460F until the prawns are done (about 10   minutes).      Serve hot with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes and spring onions.   Serves four.      From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon   Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.   ISBN 0-943389-05-4.      If you can buy coriander bunches with the roots untrimmed you'll be   in good shape.  If not, substitute stems.  I left it out as the   person I was eating with doesn't like coriander at all.  It doesn't   say to, but I cracked the peppercorns slightly before adding them to   the mix.  By light soy sauce, they mean like in thin soy, rather than   as in "lite" soy sauce.      Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce++originating in France, I believe++   popular in Asia.  It's somewhat like a slightly thick soy sauce.  It   can be found in the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in   Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick Chinese soy in   it's place. If you can find the Maggi Sauce grab it.  It lasts   virtually forever in the fridge. Get a small bottle, though.  I run   across very few recipes that call for it.  It's used as a table   condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at Vietnamese   restaurants here in the States.      The mungbean noodles are the thin, clear "cellophane" noodles.  I'd   have no qualms about using the similar thin rice noodles if I   couldn't find mungbean ones.      I picked up a neato garnish from the photo with this dish.  It shows a   green onion "brush" with a slice of red pepper around the middle.   Quite attractive and easy to make.  Cut a slice of scallion++the   whitish part++about an inch and a half long.  Slice a fresh red chili   into quarter-inch slices.  Take a length of scallion and push the   seeds and pulp out of the chili slice.  Slip the rind down to the   middle of the piece of scallion, then cut the exposed pieces of   scallion with a thin, sharp blade all the way through.  Make two cuts   vertically, then rotate the scallion and make two more cuts.  Do both   ends, then toss the bundle into a bowl of water with lots of ice   cubes and the slit ends will curl up making a nice, tassley looking   garnish that's great to eat too.  The trick is to get chilies that   are about the same diameter as the scallions so it's a snug fit.   Just toss a couple of the chilly, frilly scallions into each bowl   before serving.  It's a little touch, but it adds a lot to the   appearance of the dish.      Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; July 23 1992.  
1 1/2 lb Lean, boneless lamb from            -leg or shoulder       2 oz Cellophane noodles     1/4 lb Fresh spinach     1/4 lb Celery cabbage     1/4 c  Soy sauce       1    Tb sesame-seed oil       1    Tb dry sherry     1/2    Tb brown sugar dissolved in            -1 tb boiling water       1 tb Peanut butter thinned with            -4 tb boiling water     1/8 ts Pepper     1/2    Tb mashed red bean curd       4 c  Chicken stock fresh or            -canned       1    Finely chopped scallions     1/2 ts Chopped garlic     1/2    Tb finely chopped peeled            -ginger root     1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley     I picked up a nice little Mongolian fire pot at a sale this weekend.   That makes two that I have now.  The other is a highly polished brass   museum piece that I never use for cooking because it's such a hassle   to clean up. This one is smaller and, with the exterior parts being   made of a matte finish aluminum, much easier to keep clean.  This is   the kind you'd see in a Chinese or Japanese place and is just the   right size for two to four diners.  This one also has a neato   adjustable grate to control the heat.      I found this recipe stuffed inside the pot.  It was hand-typed.  The   amounts called for in it would be too much for the little pot I found   it in, but is sounds quite good and is probably authentic.  You   generally don't find Nam Yuey (red bean curd cheese) called for in   Westernized recipes.  The pot is a neat touch, but this can be made   just as effectively in a fondue pot or in a sauce pan on a tabletop   burner++in anything that gets the broth hot enough to cook the   ingredients.      Freeze lamb for 2 or 3 hours for ease in slicing.  Cut against the   grain into paper thin slices.  Then cut slices into 2 x 2 inch   pieces. Cover cellophane noodles with 1 cup warm water and soak for   30 minutes. Drain and cut into 6 inch lengths.  Wash spinach leaves   under cold running water and pat dry with paper towel.  Arrange on   platter along with noodles. Trim greens and root ends of the cabbage.   Separate into stalks and wash thoroughly.  Cut each stalk into small   pieces and drop into pot of boiling water.  Take out in 2 minutes,   dry and place with spinach and noodles. Combine soy sauce,   sesame-seed oil, sherry, brown sugar, peanut butter pepper and bean   curd.  Mix thoroughly, then take 1 tablespoon of the sauce and put   into each of 4 bowls.  Reserve the rest and place in small bowl.      Preheat your broiler to its highest point.  Place 8 to 10 charcoal   briquettes side by side in baking pan lined with heavy aluminum foil   and place under broiler.  Heat for 10 to 15 minutes until white ash   forms on briquettes.  Transfer to funnel of cook pot with tongs.  Put   fireproof (asbestos) mat on table and place cook pot on it.  Bring   chicken broth to a boil then pour it into the cook pot.  Give each   person a plate of lamb and a soup bowl.  Drop the scallions, garlic,   ginger, and parsley into the boiling stock.  Each person cooks own   lamb with fondue fork and then dips it into sauce in soup bowl.   Extra sauce is also placed on table.      When the lamb has been used, ladle a little of the remaining stock   into each bowl.  Add the noodles and vegetables in the remaining   stock in the cook pot, for a minute or two then ladle with broth into   bowls as another course.          1 1/2 lb Lean, boneless lamb from            -leg or shoulder       2 oz Cellophane noodles     1/4 lb Fresh spinach     1/4 lb Celery cabbage     1/4 c  Soy sauce       1    Tb sesame-seed oil       1    Tb dry sherry     1/2    Tb brown sugar dissolved in            -1 tb boiling water       1 tb Peanut butter thinned with            -4 tb boiling water     1/8 ts Pepper     1/2    Tb mashed red bean curd       4 c  Chicken stock fresh or            -canned       1    Finely chopped scallions     1/2 ts Chopped garlic     1/2    Tb finely chopped peeled            -ginger root     1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley     I picked up a nice little Mongolian fire pot at a sale this weekend.

It has been adapted for the American cook. With   this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than   those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when   buying.      Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.   Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add   noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook   until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a   colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch   lengths.      Chill.      Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it   loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt   and pepper to taste.  Cool.      Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and   coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp   and chilled noodles; mix well.      Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp   fried shallots.      Serves 4 to 6.      NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.      San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.      As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make.  Just   fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and   crisp.  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in   the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor   accent. Good stuff!      Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; September 28 1992.

There is water   everywhere in Bangkok++even in the dry season.  And everywhere there   is water, the Thais use it to grow something to eat!  Add to that the   fact that the Gulf of Thailand is not far away from the city and it   all adds up to good eatin' for seafood lover's!  The following recipe   is typical of the bewildering variety of cioppino and jambalaya type   seafood stews found there++and each one seems better than the last.   The recipe is from Joyce Jue's delightful San Francisco Chronicle   column (3/13/91).  It calls for the dish to be cooked in a Chinese   "sandy" pot.  Don't gots one? Not to worry++use whatever you have on   hand++wok, Dutch oven, stockpot...      (And yes, Marge++there are tentacles in this!)      Put the mung beans into a bowl and cover with warm water; soak until   soft and pliable, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Set aside. If you are   using a cooked crab, have the fishmonger crack it into large pieces.      To clean a live crab, be careful, and use a brush to scrub its   underside and between the claws and legs to loosen the sand and grit.   Rinse thoroughly with cold water.  Plunge the crab into boiling water   for a minute to kill it.  Remove.  When cool, clean, disjoint and   chop the crab into large chunks.      In a mortar or spice mill, pound or grind the peppercorns first, then   add the coriander root and garlic, and work it into a paste.  Mix   together the sugar, Golden Mountain, soy and oyster sauces, rice wine   and sesame oil in a bowl.      Pour the vegetable oil into a 3 1/2-quart sandy clay pot casserole   (or a Dutch oven) and set over medium heat.  Add the   coriander-garlic- pepper paste and saute lightly.      Increase the heat to high.  Add ginger, chiles and raw crab pieces;   toss and brown for a minute.  Add the shrimp an green onions to crab   mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Pour in the soy sauce mixture and   mung bean noodles; toss and mix together.  Stir in the water, cover   pot, reduce heat to medium and braise for 8 minutes, stirring   occasionally. If the noodles seem dry, add more water.      Increase heat to medium-high, and gently stir in the fish and squid   (and cooked crab if using), mix with the noodles, top with the basil   leaves. Cover and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Check for   doneness. Garnish with fresh coriander sprigs.  Bring the clay pot to   the table and serve hot with rice and vegetables.      Serves 4.

The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.         Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.      Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper   on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over   the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for   the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes   about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on   several wrappers at a time.      When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of   filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the   sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.      After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,   put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,   and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is   Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).      To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:      Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint   leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the   directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc   cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,   2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each   person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the   nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using   chopsticks or a fork.      Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.      Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables   on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a   cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips   it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.      NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps   them crisper than frying in any other oil.

I haven't tried this   one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her   stuff is usually bang-on.      In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles   in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree   ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop   and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch   lengths; set aside.      Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add   tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your   hands.      Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish   sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10   minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated   carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.      To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow   pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a   second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a   wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens   to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.      Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact   log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log   along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the   log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper   is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to   enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the   wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.      Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover   with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.      To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat   fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.   Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).   Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to   8 minutes.      Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.      Serving suggestions:      Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces .  Dip into sauce and   enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of   coriander and mint.  Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part   of a multi course meal.      NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray   with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate   them overnight, wrapped in plastic.  Don't keep them longer than 1   day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and   frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet   and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.      Makes 16 rolls.

Purchase the fish from a Japanese fish shop that   specializes in sashimi, or a reliable fishmonger.  To facilitate the   very fine shredding of the radish and carrot, use a mandolin or the   fine shredding disc of a food processor.      Chill fish until firm.  Cut into paper-thin, 2-inch-long slices   against the grain; set aside.      In separate bowls, cover radishes and carrots with cold water; set   aside until ready to assemble salad.  Then rinse and squeeze out   excess water.      To assemble:  Toss fish slices with marinade ingredients.  Place fish   in center of a platter.  Arrange daikon and carrot shreds around   fish. Scatter fresh and pickled ginger, the pickled scallions, lime   leaves, chiles, green onions and cilantro over fish.  Sprinkle with   peanuts and sesame seeds.      Just before serving, squeeze the lime or lemon juice over all. It is   customary for everyone to join in and toss the salad.  Using   chopsticks, each diner digs from the bottom of the salad and lifts   the ingredients to mix together.      When the salad is fully tossed, taste for seasoning.  Adjust with more   sesame oil, lime juice, salt and/or some of the juices from the   pickled vegetables.      Garnish with shrimp chips or fried rice stick noodles.      Serves 4 to 6.      NOTE:  Bottled pickled ginger and pickled scallions may be found in   Chinese markets.  Kaffir lime leaves may be found in Thai grocery   stores. If kaffir leaves are not available, omit or substitute   domestic lime leaves.

Bring a large quantity of water to boil in a large pot and add the   noodles. Cook the noodles until they're the texture you want, 4   minutes or so.      Drain thoroughly and sprinkle with a little sesame oil.      Quickly reheat the sauce and stir in the scallions.  Turn off the   heat and sprinkle with sesame oil.      Serve the noodles with the pork sauce on the side and any or all of   the garnishes.      San Francisco Chronicle. 1/13/88.      Posted by Stephen Ceideberg; September 28 1992.

Be sure to use tawny port. With its beautiful amber color and   slightly dry flavor, it compliments the apricots. Save your ruby   port, which is sweeter and has a deep red wine color, for after   dinner.      1. Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry.      2. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, chopped garlic,   vinegar, thyme, tarragon and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken,   toss together well and marinate at room temperature for 2-3 hours or   refrigerate overnight.      3. Remove chicken from marinade, scraping off any bits that might   remain. Reserve marinade. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a   large, heavy casserole. Brown chicken in small batches over medium   heat until golden, turning once or twice. Set finished pieces aside.      4. Add onion slices to casserole, reduce heat and cook, stirring, for   2 minutes or until they begin to brown. Toss onion slices with flour   and continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes longer.      5. Add broth, port wine and red currant jelly. Cook, stirring, for   another 2 minutes. Stir in the apricots, reserved marinade and   chicken.      6. Cook over low heat, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Remove   cover and cook for 20-30 minutes more or until chicken is cooked   through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, serve with   cooked noodles and garnish with chopped parsley.      Per serving (without noodles): 555 calories, 25 grams fat, 124   milligrams cholesterol.

Grease   or spray non-stick vegetable cooking spray on 1 medium to large   ovenproof baking dish, or two smaller dishes.      Cook the noodles according to the directions on the package, but   shorten the cooking time by 2 minutes. Drain the noodles and combine   with the peas, soup and milk. Mash the tuna with a fork to break it   up and add it to the noodles. Mix gently and spoon into prepared pan.   Sprinkle the crumbs over the top and bake for 35 minutes, until hot.      Variations: Add salt (taste first, as soup may be salted enough);   freshly grated black pepper; white pepper; snipped fresh herbs, such   as tarragon, or dried herbs. Also, if you're not an avid fan of bread   crumbs, 2 cups may be too much. Toss 1/2 to 3/4 cups with 1   tablespoon melted butter or margarine for a light sprinkling.

To make the sauce, gently saute the onion   and garlic in the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until the   onion is translucent, about five minutes.  Add the tomato paste and   stir.  Slowly add the water and stir.  Add the seasonings and allow   the sauce to simmer while preparing the manicotti and filling.      Manicotti:  Bring a large pot of water to the boil, add the olive   oil, and drop in the manicotti.  Cook al dente, about 12 minutes.   Drain and refresh under cold running water.  Set aside.      Filling:  beat the ricotta with the eggs until combined in the large   bowl of an electric mixer.  Add the grated cheeses and softened   butter, beat until combined.  Add the salt, pepper and basil.  Beat   on low just until everything is combined.  Gently fill the cooked   manicotti with the cheese mixture and arrange in two greased 9"x13"   pans.  Cover the pasta in each pan with half the sauce; sprinkle on   additional parmesan.

Drain, flush   with cold water until chilled, then roll loosely in a lint-free towel   to blot off excess water.           Toss noodles with sesame oil and salt, using your hands to coat   and separate the strands.           Heat a 12-inch well-seasoned or Silverstone heavy skillet over   high heat until hot enough to evaporate a bead of water on contact.   Add 5 tablespoons of oil, swirl to coat the bottom and sides of the   pan, then reduce heat to medium-high.           When oil is hot enough to sizzle a single noodle, coil the   noodles in a pan then use a spatula to pack them into an even pancake   or "pillow." Cover and cook until the bottom is golden, about 5-7   minutes.           Uncover, flip the noodle pillow over with a jerk of your wrist,   then cover and cook the second side.  If the pan seems dry, dribble in   the remaining tablespoon of oil around the side of the skillet before   covering it.           Slide the noodle pillow out of the pan, cut it into quarters,   then garnish with a sprinkling of black sesame seeds and vegetables.      Stir-Fried Greens:   ==================           Soak the dried mushrooms for several hours or overnight in cold   water.

Add 2 tablespoons of   oil, swirl to glaze the pan, then reduce heat to medium-high.           Add the Chinese chive tops, garlic and black mushrooms, toss   until fully fragrant, then add chanterelles, sliced scallions, and   cabbage to the pan.  Toss just until vegetables turn supple, about 2   minutes.           Add baby bok choy, toss until color deepens and the vegetables   are heated through, about 20 seconds.  If the pan becomes too dry,   dribble in a bit more oil from the side.           Fold in the chilis, then turn contents out onto a serving plate,   either alongside or on top of the noodle pillow.           Caution: Chilis are added for color and are not meant to be eaten   whole!  If a spicier dish is desired, finely sliver a single chili and   stir-fry it with the shallots before stir-frying the remaining   vegetables.            1/2 lb Noodles, egg, 1/16th-inch            -- thin, Chinese       2 ts Oil, sesame       1 ts Salt, kosher       6 tb Oil, corn OR       6 tb Oil, peanut            Seeds, sesame, black            -- (garnish)        1 tb Chives, Chinese     1/8 c  Garlic, baby, finely            -- sliced       6 md Mushrooms, dried, black   1 1/2 c  Mushrooms, chanterelle,            -- sliced   1 1/2 ts Scallion, finely sliced            -- rings       3 c  Bok choy, baby, sliced,            -- with flower-like bases            -- kept whole       2 c  Cabbage, Chinese, sliced       4 sm Chilis, red       4 sm Chilis, orange       3 tb Oil, peanut OR       3 tb Oil, corn          Boil noodles in unsalted water until "al dente."

Add water   and red peppers, and simmer the red peppers until they are slightly   softened. A bit of crunch is a good thing. There should be a fair amount of   liquid left when you are done simmering.      Cook some wide spinach noodles (I used 24oz for five of us) until they are   just a hair underdone and then drain.  Toss them with the peppers and   liquid over a low heat until pasta is coated and liquid is absorbed.

1/4 c  Rice wine       2 tb Ginger root, grated fresh       2    Garlic cloves, minced       1 c  Carrots, thinly sliced       1 c  Broccoli stems, sliced thin       1 c  Cabbage, sliced thin       2    Green onions     1/4 c  Water     1/2 ts Sesame oil, dark     1/2 ts Cayenne pepper       1 tb Honey (omit if vegan)       1 ts Hoisin sauce (optional)       4 c  Rice noodles, cooked            Soy sauce to taste     In a wok over medium-high heat, heat rice wine or mirin until bubbling. Add   ginger, garlic, carrots and broccoli.  Stir-fry until carrots soften   slightly, about five minutes.  Add cabbage and green onions; cover and cook   three minutes.  With a slotted spoon, remove vegetables to a platter and   set aside.   Add water, sesame oil, up to 1 tsp. cayenne, honey and hoisin sauce, if   desired, to wok and heat until bubbling.  Add noodles and stir-fry until   heated through.  Add vegetables and heat through.  Add soy sauce to taste.   Note: The sesame oil gives this dish a great flavor, but leave it out if   you can't afford the few grams of fat it contributes.  
1    Lettuce head       4 c  Corn oil     1/3 c  Walnut pieces       1 oz Bean thread noodles       1 T  Garlic, minced      12 oz Pork, ground       2    Green onions       1 cn Smoked clams       1 cn Water chestnuts (small)       1 c  Lettuce, coarsely chopped       1 T  Soy sauce     1/4 t  Cayenne pepper       2 T  Oyster sauce       1 t  Sherry     1/4 t  Sugar       1 t  Sesame oil       2 t  Cornstarch, mixed with       1 T  Water     Cut green onions into pea-sized pieces.  Drain and chop coarsely the smoked   clams and water chestnuts.  Detach lettuce leaves from core, wash and dry   them gently.  Arrange lettuce leaves around the edge of a large platter.      Heat oil in wok until it is about to smoke.  Tear bean thread noodles apart   and cut with scissors into small portions. Carefully put a portion of the   noodles into the hot oil.  (They will expand dramatically!) As soon as they   expand, turn them over and cook the other side briefly. Drain them and   remove to a bowl lined with several layers of paper towels. Cook the   remaining noodles in the same way.  Drain them very well with paper towels   and then crunch them and put them into the center of the serving platter,   surrounded by the lettuce leaves.      Put the walnuts into a strainer and immerse them into the hot oil. They   will brown very quickly.  Be careful they do not burn. Remove them to a   paper towel, drain well and chop into coarse pieces.      Remove all but 2 T of oil from the wok.  Saute the minced garlic and   chopped green onions until lightly browned.  Add the ground pork and saute   until it loses its pink color and starts to brown. Use a large spoon to   remove as much grease as possible from the pork mixture.      Add the chopped smoked clams, chopped water chestnuts and chopped lettuce   to the pork mixture.  Mix well.      Combine the soy sauce, cayenne, oyster sauce, sherry, sugar and sesame oil;   stir into the cooking mixture and cook for two minutes, stirring   constantly.  Remix the cornstarch and water and add to the middle of the   wok.  Stir constantly, blending other ingredients into cornstarch mixture   and simmer three more minutes.      Pour the cooked dish on top of the bean thread needles on the serving   platter.  Sprinkle the walnut pieces on top and serve at once. To eat:   Place a lettuce leaf on your plate.  Put a spoonful of the pork mixture and   noodles in the middle of the leaf.  Fold the leaf up and eat the package   like a bared.  Serves 12 as part of a family style Chinese dinner, 4 as a   main dish.  
Egg noodles            Parsley     1/2 c  Butter            MSG            Salt, to taste            Pepper, freshly ground            Sour cream            Parmesan cheese, grated            Romano cheese, grated            Garlic cloves, pressed     Cook the noodles; reserve.  Melt butter in a large saucepan.  In the   blender, liquefy "3 to 4 times as much parsley as you'd think you'd need"   with "the least amount of water possible."  Add to melted butter with   salt, MSG and "plenty" of black pepper.  Add sour cream until good sauce,   about a cup; blend.  (Don't heat sour cream too much because it might   curdle.)  Add grated cheese(s) and pressed garlic, then noodles.  
1 lb Chinese-style noodles,            -fresh     1/2 T  Garlic chili paste       2 T  Peanut butter, good            -(without added sugar)       1 T  Nam pla (fermented            -fish sauce)     1/2 c  Water       2    Scallion stalks, chopped     Boil a lot of water for the noodles; this is the most time-consuming step.      Rinse and trim scallions, then slice thinly.  In a small mixing bowl,   combine peanut butter and chili paste with a fork. Mix thoroughly. Add   water to the peanut mixture. This is tricky, since peanut butter and water   do not want to mix. Start with a tiny bit of water, mix thoroughly until it   is homogeneous, and then add some more water. You can begin to add larger   quantities of water as the sauce gets thinner. The water and peanut butter   really will mix, if you are patient.      Continue adding water until the sauce has the consistency you want; I make   it about the consistency of ketchup. Stir in the nam pla.      Once the pot of water is boiling, cook the noodles until they are just   done, and not mushy. Drain noodles and immediately mix in the sauce. Toss   until the noodles are evenly coated. Garnish with scallions and serve.      NOTES:      *  Chinese-style noodles with a spicy peanut sauce -- This recipe is not   authentic Chinese; it was created by combining readily available   ingredients and double-checking against a Satay recipe. It's close to a   Satay sauce, but not quite the same thing. It's also similar to a recipe in   "The Enchanted Broccoli Forest," by Mollie Katzen.      *  The ingredients are readily available at oriental grocery stores.   Substitute soy sauce if you can't find nam pla.  For fresh noodles, you can   substitute several packages of ramen noodles, discarding sauce powders.      *  This basic recipe may be varied by modifying quantities.  Vary the chili   paste to control hotness, and the nam pla to control saltiness (but the   sauce will taste saltier before mixing with the noodles). If you use this   as the main dish of a meal, it serves only two. This will keep for at least   a week in the refrigerator.      *  Serve with a good beer; it's too spicy for most wines.      : Difficulty:  easy.   : Time:  5 minutes, plus waiting for the water to boil.   : Precision:  No need to measure.      : Jeffrey Mogul   : Digital Equipment Corp., Western Research Lab, Palo Alto, California, USA   : mogul@decwrl.dec.com   decwrl!mogul      : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust  
2 T  Garlic, minced (fresh)       3 T  Coriander, minced            -(fresh)     1/2 c  Peanut butter       5 oz Soy sauce, light       5 T  Sugar            Rice wine (between            -1/2 t to 1 T)       1 T  Hot bean paste            -(up to 2 T)       1 T  Sesame oil       1 lb Lo mein noodles (other            -noodles will do,            -such as ramen noodles,            -or even spaghetti)     Cook the lo mein according to directions.  Let cool.  Mix the rest of the   ingredients.  Peanut butter doesn't mix very well, so for a few minutes   you'll think you've made a mistake. Don't worry, just keep stirring until   it's smooth. Add the sauce to the noodles.      Hot bean sauce also goes by the name Szechuan bean sauce etc.  This is the   main "spicy" ingredient and should be handled with care.  Vary this   ingredient to taste. This recipe is probably very good without it. It's   also quite good served when the noodles are still hot.      NOTES:      *  Mildly spicy cold noodles -- I first had this at Brandy Ho's in   Chinatown, San Francisco.

NOTES:      *  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting      *  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than   recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out   very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as   many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be   increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.      : Difficulty:  easy.   : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.   : Precision:  no need to measure.      : susan@sftig.UUCP (S.Eisen)      : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust   : AT&T Bell Laboratories, Summit, NJ

However, with a certain amount of difficulty I was   able to find all of the ingredients in specialty food stores nearby (though   admittedly I live in a wonderland of ethnic grocery stores and specialty   markets.) The recipe is so delicious that it's worth including even though   most readers will not be able to find the ingredients to make it.      North Americans can read ground beef for mince beef and bacon for middle   bacon.  You can make an interesting substitute for this dish by using   Mexican seasonings instead of Indonesian; the flavor will not be at all   authentic but some of the spirit is preserved.      : Difficulty:  easy.   : Time:  30 minutes.   : Precision:  approximate measurement OK      : Michael Oudshoorn   : Department of Computer Science,   : The University of Adelaide,   : South Australia.   : ACSnet:  mjo@uacomsci.ua.oz      : Copyright (C) 1986 USENET Community Trust

Dumplings:  In a food processor, blend the flour and 1/2 teaspoon   salt. With the motor running, add the egg yolks and the oil through   the feed tube, then pour in the water, in a slow, steady stream,   until the dough forms a ball around the blade.  Transfer the dough to   a floured surface and knead until smooth, about two minutes.  Cover   with a linen or cotton (not terry) kitchen towel and let stand half   an hour.      Divide the dough in half and shape into two balls.  Keep one ball   covered with the towel.  On a floured surface with a floured rolling   pin, roll out the dough to a very thin sheet, about 1/16" thick,   making sure it doesn't tear.  With a round cookie cutter, cut out   circles about 3" in diameter. Gather the scraps together into a ball   and set aside, covered.      Have a bowl with the egg white by you.  Place a heaping teaspoon of   the desired filling in the middle of each circle.  Fold the dough   over the filling to form a semi-circle.  Brush the edges with the egg   white and press the edges firmly together with the tines of a fork to   seal.  Place the vareniki as they are made on a lightly floured large   baking sheet about 1" apart and keep covered with a damp tea towel.   When finished with the first batch, roll out the second ball of dough   and make a second batch.  Add the leftover scraps of dough to the   scraps left from the first batch, knead into a ball, and roll out for   a final batch of varenyky.      Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil.   Reduce the heat to medium so the water simmers and carefully lower   half the varenyky into the water.  Boil, stirring occasionally with a   wooden spoon to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface and   are cooked through, six to seven minutes.  With a slotted spoon,   carefully remove the varenyky to a colander and drain thoroughly.   Transfer to a deep serving bowl and toss with half the butter.   Repeat for the second half of the varenyky.      Potato filling:  Melt the butter in a small skilled over medium heat.   Add the onion and saut#, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned,   about 15 minutes.  Remvoe from heat and cool slightly.  In a large   bowl, combine the potatoes and cheese.  Add the saut#ed onion along   with the melted butter and mix well.  Season with salt and pepper and   use for filling the varenyky.      Sauerkraut filling:  Saut# the bacon in a large skillet over medium   heat until it renders its fat.  Remove the bacon and reserve.  Drain   off all but two tablespoons fat.  Add the onion to the skillet and   saut#, stirring frequentlly over medium heat until nicely browned,   almost 15 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the kraut,   and saut#, stirring, until softened and cooked throughout, 10 to 15   minutes.  Stir in the tomato paste, sugar, and broth.  Reduce the   heat to low, then cover and simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove from the   heat and cool to room temperature before using to fill the varenyky.   Use the reserved bacon as topping.
