      Title: MARINATED CUCUMBER AND RED BELL PEPPER SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Ornish
      Yield: 4 servings
      2 oz Dry cellophane or bean
           Thread noodles
      2 c  Peeled, seeded, and sliced
           Cucumbers
      2 c  Thinly sliced red bell
           Peppers (I chopped them into
           Chunks )
      1 c  No-oil Italian dressing or
           Vinaigrette (I used less
           Than 1C -- about 3/4)
      1 T  Freshly minced basil
      1 T  Freshly miced cilantro
    1/8 t  Red hot chili flakes (I made
           My own from dried chilis)
           Lettuce
  Drop the noodles into boiling water until done (length of time depends on
  type; read the label). Drain. Toss all ingredients together and marinate
  for at least 1 hour. Serve on a bed of lettuce.
  Other tips:
  I used 3.5 oz of noodles, and less dressing. The chili makes it hot so if
  you don't like spicy, it would be fine to leave it out. You may want to
  break the noodles a little before cooking (but not too much). I made the
  mistake of not breaking them and ended up having to cut them a little in
  order to get my ingredients to combine properly.
  This salad is even better the next day. I imagine it travels nicely because
  it isn't too soupy.

      Title: SUNOMONO OR JAPANESE NOODLE AND CUCUMBER SALAD
 Categories: Digest, Oriental
      Yield: 4 servings
      5    To 6 oz. of dry vermicelli
           Noodles
      6 T  Rice vinegar
      4 t  Sugar
      2 t  Soy sauce
      1 t  Salt
      1    To 2 tbsp of sesame seeds
      1    Medium-sized cucumber
           - extra sesame seeds for the
           Top
           - scallion greens, thinly
           Sliced-optional (I used the
           Scallions greens)
  1) Cook the noodles in boiling water until just tender. Drain and rinse in
  cold water. Drain thoroughly, and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. (My
  advice, store in water if not using right away!) 2) Add vinegar, sugar, soy
  sauce, salt, and sesame seeds. Mix well. Cover and chill until cold. (Don't
  chill for too long or the noodles will stick together. I did this but was
  able to save it by adding more rice vinegar until the noodles separated
  again. It tasted great.) 3) Peel adn seed the cucumber. Cut into quarters
  lengthwise, then into thin pieces. If not serving right away, wrap the
  cucumber pieces in a plastic bag or plastic wrap and refrigerate. 4) To
  serve, divide the noodles amon 4 or 5 serving bowls. Top with a small
  handful of cucumber slices, a light sprinkling of sesame seeds, and , if
  desired, a few very thin slices of scallion greens. Serve cold.
  This salad is subtle adn very refreshing. There is a variety of
  textures-chewy cold noodles (bean thread noodles, some call them cellophane
  noodles 'cause when you boil them they become clear), crunchy sesame seeds,
  and smooth cucumber slices. Sweet, salt, and vinegar combine harmoniously,
  each understated but very much present.
  Everything except the cucumbers and toppings can be combined several days
  ahead of time. (I beg to differ on this claim because, if you don't keep
  the boiled noodles in cold water while setting them aside, they will stick
  together.) The cucumbers can be prepared ahead also, and kept separate
  until serving.
  Note: The dressing contains no oil. ( However the sesame seeds do)
  Prep time:  15 minutes, plus chilling time, Yield: 4 to 5 servings
  Bon Appetit!

 Categories: Digest, August, Lacto
      Yield: 1 servings
    1/2    Box lasagna noodles
      1 cn (1 lb) fatfree vegetarian
           Refried beans
      1 c  Chunky salsa (any degree of
           Eat you prefer)
      1 c  Fatfree or 1% fat cottage
           Cheese
      1 c  Shredded fatfree (or low fat
           If desired) cheddar cheese
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Rinse and drain.
  In a small saucepan, mix beans and salsa and heat over a medium flame until
  runny (helps to spread the mixture).  Place a small amount of the bean
  mixture in the bottom of a square 8 or 9 inch baking dish.  Layer four or
  five lasagna noodles over the dish (cut off extra length of noodle and save
  for the next noodle layer).  Spread 1/2 of the bean/salsa mix on top of
  noodles then top with 1/2 the cottage cheese and some of the cheddar. Top
  with more noodles then the remaining bean/salsa mix and cottage cheese. top
  with more cheddar and remaining noodles.  Top with a little more cheddar.
  Bake in microwave at medium-high for 10 minutes (uncovered) or in oven for
  30 minutes at 350 degrees (or until hot and bubbly).
  This was really good and alot easier than it sounds.  Giving a recipe for
  how you layer lasagna is really a pain!

      Title: BEAN LASAGNE
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
      1 cn Ff vegetarian refried beans
      1    12 oz bottle mild taco
           Sauce
      2 cn Stewed tomatoes, one
           Drained, one not
      1 c  Ff cottage cheese
      1 c  Corn kernels, frozen is ok
     10    To 12 lasagne noodles,
           Uncooked
    1/4 c  Black olives, sliced
  In a bowl mix beans with about half the juice from one can of tomatoes and
  a couple of tablespoons of taco sauce. You want the beans to be almost but
  not quite pourable. Mix the rest of the taco sauce and tomato juice and set
  aside.
  Put about a quarter of the taco sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13"
  lasagne pan. Cover sauce with a layer of noodles. Layer, in any order you
  want, the beans, corn, cheese, drained tomatoes, sauce and noodles, being
  sure to end up with enough beans to cover the top with no noodles showing.
  The resulting mess should be pretty wet.
  Cover tightly with foil.  Bake at 350 for about an hour, until the noodles
  are tender. Check every 5-10 minutes after 45 minutes of cooking to see how
  the noodles are doing. Remove foil, sprinkle with olives. Bake another
  couple of minutes. Let sit for about 5 minutes before serving.
  Serves 3-4 as a main dish. Tastes even better the next day.
  Variation: If you want to pre-cook the noodles, don't use as much tomato
  juice and cook for only about 30 minutes.
  Variation: Other veggies would work well in here too. What do you have in
  the frig?
  Variation: You could top it with a little ff cheese-stuff in the last few
  minutes. And no doubt you could make it vegan by leaving off all milk
  products altogether.

           Cheese)
      4    Cloves garlic sauteed w/ the
           Rest of the stuff
           I forgot!
           Italian herbs to taste
    1/2 c  Fatfree Parmesan
  All measurings except the six noodles (which serves 2) are approximate.
  Really, I guess you can put in about anything you like.  I left the
  mushrooms out of Ben's because he's weird that way.  Anyway, stuff this
  mixture into the shells. You may have some left over. So sue me.  Put them
  in a baking dish and pour one jar of Healthy Choice f/f spaghetti sauce
  over the noodles.   Bake at 400 F for about 45 minutes.  This is very easy
  and I hope you like it as well as we do. Mangia!

      1    (8-ounce) package
           Medium-size egg noodles,
           Uncooked
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
    1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine, melted
      3 T  All-purpose flour
      3 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 T  Poppy seeds
      1 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Red pepper
      3 c  Diced cooked tofu
      1    (4-ounce) jar diced
           Pimiento, drained
      2 T  Grated Parmesan cheese
  Cook noodles according to package directions.  Drain well, and set aside.
  Sauti onion and green pepper in butter in a Dutch oven until tender; add
  flour, stirring until smooth.  Cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.
  Gradually add milk; cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
  thickened and bubbly.  Stir in noodles, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, poppy
  seeds, salt, red pepper, and tofu; add pimiento, and stir gently. Spoon
  mixture into a lightly greased 12- x 8- x 2-inch baking dish. Cover and
  chill 8 hours.  To bake, remove from refrigerator, and let stand at room
  temperature 30 min.  Bake, covered, at 350 for 45 min.  Uncover, and
  sprinkle with 2 tablespoons cheese.  Bake, uncovered, an additional 10 min.
  or until thoroughly heated.
  1. I use one pound of tofu cut into 1 inch squares instead of turkey.  (I
  am a vegitarian.)
  2. It does not have to refrigerate, but the tastes do mingle better if it
  does.
  3. I usually sprinkle more than 2 tablespoons of cheese on top.

-DIPPING SAUCE-
    1/4 c  Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Fish sauce
    1/3 c  Lime juice
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Sa-te oil
  Soak tree ears, set aside bean thread noodles.  Chop pork to a finer
  consistency, put it in a bowl and add shrimp or crab, fish sauce,
  salt, pepper, garlic, onions and chives.  Drain and dry the tree ears
  and add them.  Add the bean thread noodles and blend thoroughly
  kneading with the hands.
  Brush the rice paper on each side with the beer and set aside.
  Cover with a cloth as you work.  They take a minute or two to soften.
  Put a heaping spoonful of the filling across the bottom third of the
  rice skin.  Tuck away from you twice.  Fold the sides over, then
  continue to roll.  Seal with beaten egg and cornstarch.  Fry in oil
  heated to about 350F until golden.  Serve with lettuce leaves,
  garnishes and dip sauce.

  fortunate to have taken classes from him in Berkeley.

   Nothing is more fascinating and delicious than eating at the open-
  air street hawker centers in Asia, particularly in Singapore.  Each
  stall serves a specialty, typically an honest, unpretentious,
  home-style dish for $1 to $3 a plate.
   This rice noodle dish is hawker food at its best.  If done right, its
  fragrance will tell you how good it's going to be as soon as it
  arrives at your table.  Singapore hawkers will use whatever seafoods
  are available, including cockles and sliced fish cakes in addition to
  those suggested in this recipe.  Feel free to experiment.
   1.  Steam the sausages for 10 minutes.  Cut them in thin diagonal
  slices. Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt.  Let them
  stand for 10 minutes, rinse well with cold water, drain, and pat dry.
  Cut the squid into 1/4 inch rings and tentacles.  Cut the barbecued
  pork into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Combine the white pepper, soy
  sauces, and oyster sauce in a bowl; set aside.
   2.  Just before cooking, put the noodles in a large bowl and pour
  boiling water over them.  Stir gently with chopsticks to separate the
  strands, drain, and shake off the excess water.
   3.  Preheat a wok; when hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the
  remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the garlic, shallots, and chiles and
  cook over medium-high heat until the garlic is golden brown.
  Increase the heat to high and toss in the shrimp and squid; stirfry
  until the shrimp turn bright orange and the squid looks opaque white,
  about 2 minutes. Add the sausage slices, barbecued pork, bean
  sprouts, and cabbage; toss and stir until the vegetables begin to
  wilt.  Remove everything in the wok to a platter and set aside.
   4.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the wok; when hot,
  toss in the well-drained noodles.  Gently toss and flip the noodles
  to heat them through.  Be careful not to break them; it is okay if
  they brown slightly. Push the noodles up the sides of the wok to make
  a well in the middle; pour in the soy sauce mixture, then toss the
  noodles gently to sauce them evenly.  Make a well again and break the
  eggs into the middle. Without mixing them with the noodles, scramble
  the eggs lightly. When the eggs begin to set, add the green onions
  and return the seafood mixture. Gently toss together to reheat and
  mix.  Serve hot, with a hot chill sauce for seasoning to taste.
  Garnish with coriander sprigs.
   NOTE:  Both here and in Asia, fresh rice noodles are usually
  purchased rather than made at home.  Look for them in Asian markets
  or Chinese take-out dim sum shops.  This dish can be prepared with
  dried rice noodles; however, it is worth taking the time to seek out
  the fresh variety.
   Make certain that your wok is well seasoned or the fragile rice
  noodles will break apart and stick to the pan.  Although I hesitate
  recommending that you cook with a non stick wok or skillet, they will
  work fine if you are more comfortable with them.
   TECHNIQUE NOTE; To clean squid, start by separating all the
  tentacles from the heads, cutting across as close as possible to the
  eyes.  Squeeze out and discard the hard, pea sized beak in the center
  of each cluster of tentacles.  Rinse the tentacles and drain them in
  a colander. Grasp the mantle (the saclike "body" of the squid) in one
  hand and the head in the other and pull apart; the entrails will pull
  out attached to the head. Pull the transparent quill out of each
  mantle.  Discard everything but the tentacles and mantles.  Running a
  little water into each mantle to open it up, reach in with a finger
  and pull out any entrails remaining inside. (Working over a second
  colander to catch all the debris will make cleanup easier.) You can
  remove the spotted outer skin or leave it on (I prefer to remove it).
  Transfer the cleaned mantles to a cutting board, slice them crosswise
  to the desired size,and add them to the tentacles in the colander.
  Give everything another rinse and drain thoroughly.
  Makes 4 to 6 servings

      Title: CHOW MEIN (TWO SIDES BROWN NOODLES)
 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 batch
     10 sm Black dried mushrooms
    1/2 lb Fresh Chinese egg noodles
           -(regular mein)
           Sesame oil
    1/2 lb Sea scallops
           Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Flank steak
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced
      1 lb Bok choy, cut in 1 1/2-inch
           -lengths
      2    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Fresh chicken stock
      2 tb Light soy sauce
           Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Peanut oil
      1 tb Or more dry sherry or
           -Shaoxing rice wine
  Here's a recipe for Chow Mein which is a pretty classic application
  using pan fried noodles.
  Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and pour boiling water over them.
  Let soak for 30 minutes.
  Meanwhile, cook the noodles in a large quantity of boiling water for
  3 1/2 to 5 minutes.  Drain, rinse under cold water, drain again, toss
  with a little sesame oil and set aside.
  Cut The scallops in half, toss with a little sesame oil and 1 1/2
  teaspoons of cornstarch; refrigerate.  Cut the flank steak as thinly
  as possible across the grain.  Toss with 1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch,
  in a little sesame oil and the dark soy sauce; set aside.  When the
  mushrooms have soaked, squeeze them out over the soaking liquid, and
  reserve 1/4 cup of the liquid.  Cut off the mushroom stems and
  discard; cut the caps in two and set aside with the bamboo shoots and
  bok choy.
  Lightly beat the eggs with a few drops of sesame oil.  Heat a small
  frying pan and oil the bottom lightly.  Pour in enough of the beaten
  egg to cover the bottom, pouring any excess back into the uncooked
  eggs. Cook just until set and remove.  Repeat until all the egg is
  used up. Stack the egg crepes, roll them up and slice across the roll
  into shreds. Set aside.
  Mix the chicken stock with the light soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  and the sugar; set aside.  Heat this mixture in a small pot over low
  heat.
  Meanwhile, heat a wok over medium high heat until hot.  Add 1 cup
  peanut oil and heat until the oil is very hot.  Lower the noodles
  into the oil to form a nest and let them cook until brown on one
  side.  (This may take 8 minutes or so.) Turn the noodles over and
  brown on the other side. (This will be much faster.) Remove to a
  large serving platter and keep warm.
  Cook the scallops very briefly in the same oil, remove and drain in a
  colander.  Turn the heat off under the oil and add the beef.  Stir
  just until the meat slices are separated and start to change color.
  Remove to drain with the scallops.
  Pour off all the oil but 1/4 cup and heat.  Add the vegetables and
  stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the seasoned stock and bring to a
  boil. Mix the reserved mushroom soaking liquid with 2 tablespoons of
  cornstarch until dissolved and stir into the chicken stock sauce.
  Stir until it thickens and clears slightly.  Add the beef and
  scallops, then the wine and cook just until heated through.  Pour
  over the noodles and serve garnished with the egg shreds.

     24    Raw medium shrimp, peeled
           -with tail section
           -attached, deveined
           Peanut oil, for frying
  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!
  Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  Set aside.
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in
  batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or
  let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat
  for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove
  the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low
  oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as
  an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a
  main course.
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

  The book notes that true Buddhist vegetarians would not use garlic or
  fish sauce and would limit the dips to plain soy or plum sauce.
  Unless you are in this category, Peanut Sauce (Nuoc Leo) and Nuoc
  Cham are great dips as well.
  Prepare the Vegetable Platter, noodles and dipping sauce.  Set aside.
  Soak the noodles in warm water and the mushrooms in hot water for 30
  minutes; drain.  Cut the noodles into 1/2-inch lengths.  Remove and
  discard the stems from the mushrooms; squeeze to extract most of the
  soaking liquid.  Mince all of the mushrooms.
  Combine all of the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; blend
  well with your hands.  Set aside.
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a large bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.
  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with only 4 sheets at a time,
  keeping the remaining sheets covered with a barely damp cloth to
  prevent curling.
  Immerse the rice paper, one sheet at a time, into the sweetened warm
  water. Quickly withdraw it and lay it flat on a dry towel.  Do this
  with 4 sheets without letting them touch each other.  The rice paper
  will become pliable within seconds.
  Fold over the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press it into a
  compact rectangle.  Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side.  Roll from the bottom to the top to completely
  enclose the filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.  (The
  rolls can be prepared 1 day in advance.  Wrap and refrigerate.)
  Fry the rolls:  If possible use 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 inches
  of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in batches, add
  some of the rolls without letting them touch, or they will stick
  together. Fry for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and
  crisp.  Remove the rolls from the oil with tongs and drain on paper
  towels.  Keep warm in a low oven until all of th rolls are cooked.
  To serve, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with some
  noodles and selected items from the Vegetable Platter and dips the
  package in the dipping sauce.
  NOTE:  The fried rolls can be frozen, then thawed and reheated in a
  350F oven just to crisp and heat through.

  Here's a goody that came out of my new Thai cookbook.  It's easy and
  quick to do and quite tasty.  It's a baked dish, which is unusual for
  Thai cooking.  I suspect that originally, it would have been steamed.
  Next time I'll try it that way or put a tablespoon of water or sherry
  in each bowl. It seemed a tad dry to me.  I cooked it in individual
  French onion soup bowls with lids.
  Place the oil in a wok, heat and stir fry the coriander root, ginger,
  pepper and onion.  When fragrant, remove from the wok and place in a
  mixing bowl.
  Add the noodles, the sauces. salt, sugar, sesame oil and whiskey,
  toss the noodles until well coated, and then add the prawns and toss
  well once again.
  Divide the noodles and prawns into four individual portions; place
  each portion in a lidded cup, and close the lids.  Place the cups on
  a baking tray and bake at 460F until the prawns are done (about 10
  minutes).
  Serve hot with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes and spring onions.
  Serves four.

  If you can buy coriander bunches with the roots untrimmed you'll be
  in good shape.  If not, substitute stems.  I left it out as the
  person I was eating with doesn't like coriander at all.  It doesn't
  say to, but I cracked the peppercorns slightly before adding them to
  the mix.  By light soy sauce, they mean like in thin soy, rather than
  as in "lite" soy sauce.
  Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce++originating in France, I believe++
  popular in Asia.  It's somewhat like a slightly thick soy sauce.  It
  can be found in the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in
  Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick Chinese soy in
  it's place. If you can find the Maggi Sauce grab it.  It lasts
  virtually forever in the fridge. Get a small bottle, though.  I run
  across very few recipes that call for it.  It's used as a table
  condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at Vietnamese
  restaurants here in the States.
  The mungbean noodles are the thin, clear "cellophane" noodles.  I'd
  have no qualms about using the similar thin rice noodles if I
  couldn't find mungbean ones.
  I picked up a neato garnish from the photo with this dish.  It shows a
  green onion "brush" with a slice of red pepper around the middle.
  Quite attractive and easy to make.  Cut a slice of scallion++the
  whitish part++about an inch and a half long.  Slice a fresh red chili
  into quarter-inch slices.  Take a length of scallion and push the
  seeds and pulp out of the chili slice.  Slip the rind down to the
  middle of the piece of scallion, then cut the exposed pieces of
  scallion with a thin, sharp blade all the way through.  Make two cuts
  vertically, then rotate the scallion and make two more cuts.  Do both
  ends, then toss the bundle into a bowl of water with lots of ice
  cubes and the slit ends will curl up making a nice, tassley looking
  garnish that's great to eat too.  The trick is to get chilies that
  are about the same diameter as the scallions so it's a snug fit.
  Just toss a couple of the chilly, frilly scallions into each bowl
  before serving.  It's a little touch, but it adds a lot to the
  appearance of the dish.

      Title: LAMB IN COOK POT
 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
  1 1/2 lb Lean, boneless lamb from
           -leg or shoulder
      2 oz Cellophane noodles
    1/4 lb Fresh spinach
    1/4 lb Celery cabbage
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      1    Tb sesame-seed oil
      1    Tb dry sherry
    1/2    Tb brown sugar dissolved in
           -1 tb boiling water
      1 tb Peanut butter thinned with
           -4 tb boiling water
    1/8 ts Pepper
    1/2    Tb mashed red bean curd
      4 c  Chicken stock fresh or
           -canned
      1    Finely chopped scallions
    1/2 ts Chopped garlic
    1/2    Tb finely chopped peeled
           -ginger root
    1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley
  I picked up a nice little Mongolian fire pot at a sale this weekend.
  That makes two that I have now.  The other is a highly polished brass
  museum piece that I never use for cooking because it's such a hassle
  to clean up. This one is smaller and, with the exterior parts being
  made of a matte finish aluminum, much easier to keep clean.  This is
  the kind you'd see in a Chinese or Japanese place and is just the
  right size for two to four diners.  This one also has a neato
  adjustable grate to control the heat.
  I found this recipe stuffed inside the pot.  It was hand-typed.  The
  amounts called for in it would be too much for the little pot I found
  it in, but is sounds quite good and is probably authentic.  You
  generally don't find Nam Yuey (red bean curd cheese) called for in
  Westernized recipes.  The pot is a neat touch, but this can be made
  just as effectively in a fondue pot or in a sauce pan on a tabletop
  burner++in anything that gets the broth hot enough to cook the
  ingredients.
  Freeze lamb for 2 or 3 hours for ease in slicing.  Cut against the
  grain into paper thin slices.  Then cut slices into 2 x 2 inch
  pieces. Cover cellophane noodles with 1 cup warm water and soak for
  30 minutes. Drain and cut into 6 inch lengths.  Wash spinach leaves
  under cold running water and pat dry with paper towel.  Arrange on
  platter along with noodles. Trim greens and root ends of the cabbage.
  Separate into stalks and wash thoroughly.  Cut each stalk into small
  pieces and drop into pot of boiling water.  Take out in 2 minutes,
  dry and place with spinach and noodles. Combine soy sauce,
  sesame-seed oil, sherry, brown sugar, peanut butter pepper and bean
  curd.  Mix thoroughly, then take 1 tablespoon of the sauce and put
  into each of 4 bowls.  Reserve the rest and place in small bowl.
  Preheat your broiler to its highest point.  Place 8 to 10 charcoal
  briquettes side by side in baking pan lined with heavy aluminum foil
  and place under broiler.  Heat for 10 to 15 minutes until white ash
  forms on briquettes.  Transfer to funnel of cook pot with tongs.  Put
  fireproof (asbestos) mat on table and place cook pot on it.  Bring
  chicken broth to a boil then pour it into the cook pot.  Give each
  person a plate of lamb and a soup bowl.  Drop the scallions, garlic,
  ginger, and parsley into the boiling stock.  Each person cooks own
  lamb with fondue fork and then dips it into sauce in soup bowl.
  Extra sauce is also placed on table.
  When the lamb has been used, ladle a little of the remaining stock
  into each bowl.  Add the noodles and vegetables in the remaining
  stock in the cook pot, for a minute or two then ladle with broth into
  bowls as another course.
  Makes 4 servings.

      Yield: 4 servings
      2 oz Dried mung bean noodles
      1 tb To 2 tb vegetable oil
      1    Whole chicken breast,
           -boned, skinned and
           -coarsely chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Fresh red or green chile,

      1 ts Sugar
      3    Shallots, peeled, thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves
      6 oz Cooked bay shrimp
           Shredded lettuce
      1 tb To 2 tb crisp-fried shallots
           -(optional)
  This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the
  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With
  this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than
  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when
  buying.
  Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.
  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add
  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook
  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a
  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch
  lengths.
  Chill.
  Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it
  loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt
  and pepper to taste.  Cool.
  Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and
  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp
  and chilled noodles; mix well.
  Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp
  fried shallots.
  Serves 4 to 6.
  NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.
  San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.
  As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make.  Just
  fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and
  crisp.  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in
  the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor
  accent. Good stuff!

      4    Red chilies, chopped into
           -1/2 inch pieces
      6 oz Medium shrimp (36 to 40
           -per count), shelled,
           -deveined, patted dry
      4    Green onions, cut into
           -2-inch lengths
      1    To 1/2 cup water
      1 lb Fresh fish filets, cut into
           -1-inch pieces
    1/2 lb Large squid, cleaned, cut
           -crosswise into 1-inch rings
    1/2 c  Thai sweet basil leaves
           Fresh coriander sprigs
  Thailand is truly a place for seafood lovers.  There is water
  everywhere in Bangkok++even in the dry season.  And everywhere there
  is water, the Thais use it to grow something to eat!  Add to that the
  fact that the Gulf of Thailand is not far away from the city and it
  all adds up to good eatin' for seafood lover's!  The following recipe
  is typical of the bewildering variety of cioppino and jambalaya type
  seafood stews found there++and each one seems better than the last.
  The recipe is from Joyce Jue's delightful San Francisco Chronicle
  column (3/13/91).  It calls for the dish to be cooked in a Chinese
  "sandy" pot.  Don't gots one? Not to worry++use whatever you have on
  hand++wok, Dutch oven, stockpot...
  (And yes, Marge++there are tentacles in this!)
  Put the mung beans into a bowl and cover with warm water; soak until
  soft and pliable, about 10 minutes.  Drain.  Set aside. If you are
  using a cooked crab, have the fishmonger crack it into large pieces.
  To clean a live crab, be careful, and use a brush to scrub its
  underside and between the claws and legs to loosen the sand and grit.
  Rinse thoroughly with cold water.  Plunge the crab into boiling water
  for a minute to kill it.  Remove.  When cool, clean, disjoint and
  chop the crab into large chunks.
  In a mortar or spice mill, pound or grind the peppercorns first, then
  add the coriander root and garlic, and work it into a paste.  Mix
  together the sugar, Golden Mountain, soy and oyster sauces, rice wine
  and sesame oil in a bowl.
  Pour the vegetable oil into a 3 1/2-quart sandy clay pot casserole
  (or a Dutch oven) and set over medium heat.  Add the
  coriander-garlic- pepper paste and saute lightly.
  Increase the heat to high.  Add ginger, chiles and raw crab pieces;
  toss and brown for a minute.  Add the shrimp an green onions to crab
  mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds.  Pour in the soy sauce mixture and
  mung bean noodles; toss and mix together.  Stir in the water, cover
  pot, reduce heat to medium and braise for 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. If the noodles seem dry, add more water.
  Increase heat to medium-high, and gently stir in the fish and squid
  (and cooked crab if using), mix with the noodles, top with the basil
  leaves. Cover and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer.  Check for
  doneness. Garnish with fresh coriander sprigs.  Bring the clay pot to
  the table and serve hot with rice and vegetables.
  Serves 4.

           -flaked with fingers
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
----PREPARATIONS FOR ASSEMBLING----
     20    Sheets dried rice papers
           -(banh trang)
      4    Eggs, well beaten
      2 c  Peanut oil
ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR SERVING
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           Carrot Salad
           Double recipe of Nuoc Cham
  Here they are!  The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.
  Yields 80 spring rolls.
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
  Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper
  on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over
  the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for
  the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes
  about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on
  several wrappers at a time.
  When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of
  filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the
  sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.
  After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
  put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,
  and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
  To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:
  Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint
  leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the
  directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc
  cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,
  2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each
  person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the
  nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using
  chopsticks or a fork.
  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.
  Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables
  on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a
  cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips
  it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.
  NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps
  them crisper than frying in any other oil.

      1    Fresh or dried red chile
           -seeded, finely minced
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Finely grated carrot
  Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial
  favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  I haven't tried this
  one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her
  stuff is usually bang-on.
  In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles
  in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree
  ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop
  and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch
  lengths; set aside.
  Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add
  tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your
  hands.
  Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish
  sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10
  minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated
  carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.
  To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow
  pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a
  second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a
  wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens
  to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.
  Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact
  log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log
  along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the
  log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper
  is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to
  enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the
  wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.
  Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover
  with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.
  To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat
  fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).
  Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to
  8 minutes.
  Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.
  Serving suggestions:
  Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces .  Dip into sauce and
  enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of
  coriander and mint.  Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part
  of a multi course meal.
  NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray
  with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate
  them overnight, wrapped in plastic.  Don't keep them longer than 1
  day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and
  frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet
  and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.
  Makes 16 rolls.

           -(daikon)
      2 c  Peeled, finely shredded
           -carrot

           -leaves, finely shredded
           -(optional)
      1 lg Red jalapeno chile, seeded
           -and finely shredded
    1/2 bn Green onions, finely
           -shredded
    1/2 bn Cilantro, leaves only
    1/4 c  Chopped peanuts
           Toasted sesame seeds, for
           -garnish
      1    Lime or lemon, cut in half
           -and seeded
           Crisp fried shrimp chips
           -or:
           Fried rice stick noodles,
           -for garnish
           MARINADE:
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 tb Asian sesame oil
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/8 ts Five-spice powder
           Juice of 1 lemon
  * (about 6 x 2 x 1/2-inch piece)
  The quality and freshness of the fish is crucial for the success of
  the dish.  Purchase the fish from a Japanese fish shop that
  specializes in sashimi, or a reliable fishmonger.  To facilitate the
  very fine shredding of the radish and carrot, use a mandolin or the
  fine shredding disc of a food processor.
  Chill fish until firm.  Cut into paper-thin, 2-inch-long slices
  against the grain; set aside.
  In separate bowls, cover radishes and carrots with cold water; set
  aside until ready to assemble salad.  Then rinse and squeeze out
  excess water.
  To assemble:  Toss fish slices with marinade ingredients.  Place fish
  in center of a platter.  Arrange daikon and carrot shreds around
  fish. Scatter fresh and pickled ginger, the pickled scallions, lime
  leaves, chiles, green onions and cilantro over fish.  Sprinkle with
  peanuts and sesame seeds.
  Just before serving, squeeze the lime or lemon juice over all. It is
  customary for everyone to join in and toss the salad.  Using
  chopsticks, each diner digs from the bottom of the salad and lifts
  the ingredients to mix together.
  When the salad is fully tossed, taste for seasoning.  Adjust with more
  sesame oil, lime juice, salt and/or some of the juices from the
  pickled vegetables.
  Garnish with shrimp chips or fried rice stick noodles.
  Serves 4 to 6.
  NOTE:  Bottled pickled ginger and pickled scallions may be found in
  Chinese markets.  Kaffir lime leaves may be found in Thai grocery
  stores. If kaffir leaves are not available, omit or substitute
  domestic lime leaves.

           -each, wing tips trimmed
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves, coarsely
           -chopped
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Dried tarragon
    1/2 t  Coarsely ground black pepper
      1 lg Onion, halved and thinly

      2 tb All-purpose flour
      2 c  Defatted chicken broth
      1 c  Medium tawny port
      1 tb Red currant jelly
      2 c  Dried apricots
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
           Cooked noodles (opt)
      1 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley,
           -for garnish
  Marinating the chicken in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, dried thyme and
  tarragon add great depth to a rice sauce that's smoothed by just a
  hint of red currant jelly and enhanced with apricots and tawny port.
  Be sure to use tawny port. With its beautiful amber color and
  slightly dry flavor, it compliments the apricots. Save your ruby
  port, which is sweeter and has a deep red wine color, for after
  dinner.
  1. Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry.
  2. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, chopped garlic,
  vinegar, thyme, tarragon and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken,
  toss together well and marinate at room temperature for 2-3 hours or
  refrigerate overnight.
  3. Remove chicken from marinade, scraping off any bits that might
  remain. Reserve marinade. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a
  large, heavy casserole. Brown chicken in small batches over medium
  heat until golden, turning once or twice. Set finished pieces aside.
  4. Add onion slices to casserole, reduce heat and cook, stirring, for
  2 minutes or until they begin to brown. Toss onion slices with flour
  and continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes longer.
  5. Add broth, port wine and red currant jelly. Cook, stirring, for
  another 2 minutes. Stir in the apricots, reserved marinade and
  chicken.
  6. Cook over low heat, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Remove
  cover and cook for 20-30 minutes more or until chicken is cooked
  through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, serve with
  cooked noodles and garnish with chopped parsley.

  with the peas, soup and milk. Mash the tuna with a fork to break it
  up and add it to the noodles. Mix gently and spoon into prepared pan.
  Sprinkle the crumbs over the top and bake for 35 minutes, until hot.
  Variations: Add salt (taste first, as soup may be salted enough);
  freshly grated black pepper; white pepper; snipped fresh herbs, such
  as tarragon, or dried herbs. Also, if you're not an avid fan of bread
  crumbs, 2 cups may be too much. Toss 1/2 to 3/4 cups with 1

      Title: NOODLES WITH SNOW PEA GREENS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 servings
    1/2 lb Snow pea greens
      2    Red chilies
        x  Some rice wine (sake,
           Shaohsing, whatever)
    1/2 c  Chopped shallots
     12    Fresh shiitake mushrooms
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 ts Rice vinegar
      4    Chopped scallions
      8    To 12 ounces japanese
           Noodles (soba, udon,
           Whatever -- I used soba)
  Lightly steam pea greens -- crisp, but cooked. Chop chilies, shallots and
  scallons.  Slice shiitake thinly.
  Heat large non-stick skillet.  Roast chilies for a minute, then add about
  1/4 cup rice wine.  Add shallots and cook till they just start to darken
  (about 4 minutes).  Add more wine if it starts to stick.
  (put water on to boil for noodles)
  With wine cooked off, add shiitake.  They should give up their own water.
  Cook another 3-5 minutes till mushrooms are fully cooked and pan is drying
  out.  Add soy sauce, vinegar, and scallions.  Cook for a minute and then
  turn off burner and set aside.
  Water for noodles should be boiling, add noodles and cook till done, about
  5 minutes usually.
  Toss noodles, pea greens and mushrooms.  Eat.
  Ya know, slivered shiitake reminds me of tripe when it cooks.  I bet if you
  substituted shiitake for the tripe in a good recipe it would make a tasty
  dish.

      2 T  Basil, fresh; finely chopped
           Parmesan; for sprinkling
  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  To make the sauce, gently saute the onion
  and garlic in the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat until the
  onion is translucent, about five minutes.  Add the tomato paste and
  stir.  Slowly add the water and stir.  Add the seasonings and allow
  the sauce to simmer while preparing the manicotti and filling.
  Manicotti:  Bring a large pot of water to the boil, add the olive
  oil, and drop in the manicotti.  Cook al dente, about 12 minutes.
  Drain and refresh under cold running water.  Set aside.
  Filling:  beat the ricotta with the eggs until combined in the large
  bowl of an electric mixer.  Add the grated cheeses and softened
  butter, beat until combined.  Add the salt, pepper and basil.  Beat
  on low just until everything is combined.  Gently fill the cooked
  manicotti with the cheese mixture and arrange in two greased 9"x13"
  pans.  Cover the pasta in each pan with half the sauce; sprinkle on
  additional parmesan.  Bake for about 20 minutes, until the cheese is
  thoroughly melted and the sauce is bubbling.
