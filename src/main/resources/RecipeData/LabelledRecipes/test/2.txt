  Hugo Arnold's Commentary Follows.
  THAI food seems to have erupted into British life over the past few
  years, particularly in pubs, where many have ditched sausages and chips
  for Nam Tok, Tom Yam Gung or Grat Doo Moo Nueng Dow Jeow - the latter
  being Thai spare ribs. Alongside this explosion runs the increasing
  availability of the ingredients necessary to produce these dishes -
  lemon grass, kaffir lime, galangal and a few cookery books to explain
  the process.
  Vatcharin Bhumichitr wants us not only to cook Thai food, but to
  understand it. His latest book, Vatch's Thai Cookbook (Pavilion 17.99),
  groups recipes and writings under different ingredient headings. This
  approach, he hopes, will enable readers to appreciate the subtleties and
  origins of this intrinsically delicate cuisine. Mr Bhumichitr owns
  Chiang Mai, a Thai restaurant in Soho that serves up the sort of food I
  remember eating in Bangkok - light, delicate, spicy and well balanced an
  aspect frequently misunderstood, but well explained in this title. His
  book is full of similar recipes. Most are remarkably quick to cook, and
  ideal for that Thursday evening when you don't really have time to cook
  a stew or casserole. Today's recipe is from the bamboo shoots section of
  the book.

       Pack half of the mixture into the lined terrine.
       Add the duck breasts and fat strips, then cover with the remaining
  forcemeat.
       Cover the contents of the terrine with foil and a good lid (to
  weight it down and keep the filling from puffing up and running over the
  side) and bake in a larger pan filled with water to half the depth of
  the terrine.
       Bake at 280 F for 2 to 3 hours or until the juices are clear.

 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 recipe
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let stand while you prepare the
  rest of the soup.  In a medium saucepan, place the coconut milk, lemon
  grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and (optionally) chiles.
  (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole dish to taste
  spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the hotter the
  resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
  stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
  below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
  pieces are finished cooking.  Remove from heat and serve immediately
  with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
  of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
  birds.  We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
  southeast Asian or Caribbean?  Who cares, it was wonderful.  If you
  can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
  ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
  monkfish.  I believe I've had this with shrimp as well.  (Grouper,
  BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in
  other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very
  tender, and quite delicately flavored.  I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd
  guess that Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  Notes:
  ======
  1.  Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available in most
  Asian groceries.  If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin
  Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in
  from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
  could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
  mild.  I like it in the middle.
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
  can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient
  demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just
  eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

  Spoon over cooked pasta -- spaghetti, fettuccine or medium-sized tubles,
  shells or other shapes are recommended.
  Directions for roasting bell peppers:
  ~-
  Place the peppers in a foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven.
  Roast until their skins are evenly blistered and browned, about 25
  minutes, turning them 2 or 3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them from
  the oven and cover them with a kitchen towel.
  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, pull out their stems, peel
  away their blackened skins; open the peppers up; and remove their seeds,
  using a teaspoon to pick up any stray ones.
  Take care not to lose any of the peppers' juices, which are also very
  flavorful. You might want to pour them through a fine mesh strainer to
  remove any seeds or bits of skin.
      Title: CHICKEN-THYME STEW WITH SOUR CREAM
 Categories: Cyberealm, Ww, Poultry, Mom's best, Kooknet
      Yield: 4 servings
     15 oz Boneless chicken breasts
      1 tb + 1 tsp olive oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2 cl Garlic, minced
      1 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Chopped parsley
  1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Chicken seasoning(I added)
      1 oz (2 T) dry sherry
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Nonfat sour cream
  1. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. In a large nonstick skillet,
  over medium high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until hot but not
  smoking. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until browned, about 3-5
  minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.
  2. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion
  and garlic, and cook, stirring until the onion begins to brown (3-5
  minutes). Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is no
  longer visible, about 30 seconds.
  3. Add the mushrooms, chicken broth, parsley, sherry, thyme, and
  pepper, and bring to a boil, stirring, until the mixture has
  thickened slightly. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until
  heated through, about 1 minute.
  4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream.
  NOTE: You can make this ahead of time, reserving the addition of the
  sour cream just before you serve it. I served this over cooked egg
  noodles, with French bread and chunky applesauce, and it was GREAT!

      Title: STEAMED ANISE CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
      2    Limes
      1 tb Brown sugar
      4    Star anise, divided (see
           Note)
    1/8 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
    1/3 c  Water
      4    Boneless and skinless
           Chicken breast halves
  1. Squeeze the juice out of the limes.  Reserve the peels.  Measure 3
     tablespoons juice.
  2. In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, brown sugar, 2 star anise,
     crushed red pepper, soy sauce and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the
     heat and simmer 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.
  3. Put the chicken in a glass dish and spoon half of the soy mixture over,
     turning to coat.  Marinate at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and
     refrigerate for longer marination, up to 24 hours.
  4. When ready to steam the chicken, put the lime peels, 2 star anise and
     about 8 cups of water into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Fit a
     steamer basket or rack over the top.  Remove the chicken from the
     marinade, discarding the leftover marinade, and place in the steamer.
     Cover tightly and steam about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is no
     longer pink in the center.
  5. In a small saucepan cook down the remaining soy mixture until reduced
     to about 2 tablespoons.  (You can add a little water if you reduce the
     mixture too much.)  Spoon over the steamed chicken.
  Note: Star anise is a dried spice with a pungent, licorice flavour.  It
  can be purchased at most Asian groceries.  You can substitute 1/2 teaspoon
  lightly crushed anise seed for 2 star anise, although the flavour will not
  be as distinctive.

  shrimp.  Stir-fry two minutes, or until shrimp are pink and opaque.
  Add cooked rice, onion mixture and ham.  Stir until hot.  Remove from heat,
  put into a storage container and chill overnight. When ready to serve,
  reheat in a wok or large pot.  Stir in snow peas and cook two minutes. Make
  a well in the center of the wok and stir in the beaten eggs. Stir them as
  they cook, about 3 minutes, so they scramble and mix with the other
  ingredients. Cover and cook over medium heat another couple of minutes.
  Serve at once.
  Serves 12 as part of a family style Chinese dinner, or 4 as a main dish.
  Vicki's notes:
  *  When Cathe originally gave me this recipe in the mid 70's it called for
  just 3/4 cup shrimp (1/2 pound), 1/2 cup each diced onion and celery, 1/2
  cup boiled ham (1/4 lb), 1/2 cup peas (cooked just tender), 3 eggs and
  sprouts. Also, just 1 clove garlic, which was heated with the ginger
  (discarded when brown) before cooking the chicken.
  *  I like to add 1/2 c red bell pepper (diced) for color.

      Title: SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE ROUGE ET VERT
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
      1    Chicken breast,
           -whole
----MARINADE----
           Juice of 1 lime
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 t  Ginger
      1    Garlic clove,
           -finely chopped
      1 pn Tarragon
SAUCE
           Juice of 1 lime
      3 oz White wine
           Butter (salted)
      3 oz Tomato paste
  Mix the marinade ingredients.  Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2
  supremes, and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Reserve bones.
  Cook a bouillon using the bones.  You will need about 3 oz of bouillon.
  Drain, flatten and flour the supremes.  Saute quickly in clarified butter,
  about two minutes on each side.  Remove and keep warm.
  Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste and bouillon.
  Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much. Remove from heat
  and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter. If you remove the sauce too soon, it
  will be too soupy. The sauce should be cinnamon-coloured and shiny. There
  will be very little sauce, you may need a rubber scraper to get it out of
  the pan.
  Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.
  Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients.  I have just
  strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that.  Wear a raincoat
  when making the sauce.  It splatters.
  NOTES:
  *  Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce -- This recipe was originally
  posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax. The French name
  means "boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce." I like it a lot.
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  30 minutes marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Poultry, Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
      8    Chicken breast
           -halves (boned)
      6 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(or less; vary amount
           -to taste)
      2 c  Mayonnaise
      4 t  Curry powder
      3 t  Olive oil
      1 t  Cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
      1 t  Fruit vinegar
  Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken and
  the grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into the sauce and
  then eating it).
  Broil the chicken breasts (3-5 minutes on each side in a preheated
  broiler), then dice or shred into small bite-sized pieces.
  Mix chopped chicken with about 2 cups of whole grapes.  Cover with the
  sauce. Add more grapes to taste. My taste is to add vast quantities of
  grapes.
  NOTES:
  *  Chicken fruit salad curry -- One day I was invited to a beach picnic,
  and asked to bring a salad. A friend and I got together in his kitchen and
  concocted a curried chicken salad with grapes.  It was delicious, but we
  forgot to write down the recipe.  After some more experimentation, I have
  come up with this recipe. I don't know if it is the same as what we made
  that day at the beach, but it is delicious.
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes including cooking the chicken.

 Categories: Poultry, Stir-fry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
     12    Mushrooms (white)
    1/2 lb Broccoli, fresh
           -(or 1 pk frozen)
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      2 T  Soy sauce
      2 T  Sherry
      1 T  Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower oil
           -is good, too)
    1/2 t  Cornstarch
      6 oz Bamboo shoots, canned
           -(optional)
      6 oz Cashew nuts, broken
           -into large pieces
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.  Wash and slice the
  mushrooms.  If using fresh broccoli, wash and cut it up into bite-sized
  pieces.  If using frozen broccoli, heat it or partially thaw it first.
  Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry and about 1 T cornstarch.  Stir
  well and set aside.
  Combine beaten egg white, salt, about 1/2 t oil and about 2 t cornstarch.
  Add the chicken cubes to the mixture and stir until the chicken is
  well-coated. In a wok or deep cast iron pan, heat about 3 T vegetable oil
  until hot. Add the chicken pieces in small batches and stir continuously
  until golden brown. After each batch is finished, remove and drain. Add oil
  sparingly as needed.
  Stir fry the mushrooms in the wok.  Stir fry the broccoli in the wok.
  Combine the chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, bamboo shoots and cashew nuts in
  the wok. Stir fry to get everything warm again. Add the bouillon-cornstarch
  sauce and stir until thickened.
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  NOTES:
  *  Chinese stir-fried chicken with broccoli and nuts.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  *  Bamboo shoots are available in cans at Chinese grocery stores.  Fresh
  broccoli is preferable to frozen, and it should be stir-fried for only a
  few minutes to keep it crunchy. Endless variations of this basic recipe are
  possible.  Beef, pork, or other lean meats can be substituted for the
  chicken. Tofu cubes or brown beans can be used to make this a vegetarian
  recipe. Chopped almonds can be used instead of cashews. Water chestnuts are
  a delightful addition. Green or red bell peppers can be used instead of
  broccoli.

 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
      1 t  Ginger, chopped
      1    Egg white
    1/2 t  Salt
      2 t  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower is
           -good, too)
      1    Green (bell) pepper
      6    Carrots
     12 oz Pineapple chunks, canned
           -(drained, but reserve
           -about 1/2 cup of
           -the juice)
           SAUCE
      2 t  Sherry
      2 t  Light soy sauce
      1 T  Vinegar
      1 t  Sugar
      1 T  Cornstarch
      1 t  Salt
  Cut up the chicken into bite-sized chunks.  Combine ginger, egg white,
  about 1/2 teaspoons each salt and cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon oil. Add
  the chicken chunks and stir until the chicken is well-coated.
  Wash green pepper.  Discard seeds and stem.  Cut into strips about 1 x 1/4
  inches.  Peel carrots.  If they are thick, cut in half lengthwise.  Cut
  diagonally into pieces about 1 inch long.  Cook the carrots in boiling
  water for 3-5 minutes, depending how crunchy you like your carrots.
  Drain pineapple chunks, saving about 1/2 cup of the juice.  Prepare the
  sweet and sour sauce by mixing sherry, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, reserved
  pineapple juice, about 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon salt.
  Stir well and set aside.
  Heat about 3 tablespoon of oil very hot in a wok or deep cast iron pan.
  Peanut oil is best since it has a high smoking point.  Stir-fry the chicken
  by putting a small batch (e.g., 5 pieces) of the cubed chicken in the wok
  and stirring continuously until golden brown. Remove to a dish. Repeat
  until all the chicken has been cooked, adding small amounts of oil as it
  gets used up.
  Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in an empty wok.  Stir fry the parboiled
  carrots and the green pepper for 30 seconds. Add the chicken and the
  pineapple chunks to the vegetables in the wok. Stir 1 minute or until well
  mixed and reheated. Add sweet and sour sauce to wok. Stir until thickened.
  Serve with rice.  I serve this recipe to company all the time and am amazed
  at how many people don't realize that you can cook Chinese food at home. It
  is always a big hit. The recipe works equally well with lean pork, tofu
  cubes, or soy beans instead of the chicken.
  NOTES:
  *  A nice Chinese dinner you can make at home -- Don't forget to start
  cooking the rice so it will be done at the same time as the chicken.

      Title: DEEP-FRIED LEMON CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Parties, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Red bell pepper
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
BATTER
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Baking powder,
           -double-acting
    1/2 t  Vegetable oil
SAUCE
      1    Lemon
      3 T  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
      1 t  Cornstarch
      2 t  Water
           Parsley sprigs
  Wash and seed the peppers.  Cut each one into strips about 2 x 1/4 inches.
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into strips about 3 x 1/2 inches.
  Prepare the batter by mixing in a bowl the flour, cornstarch, baking
  powder, salt, water and oil. Stir until smooth.
  Cut half of the lemon into thin semicircular slices.  Prepare the lemon
  sauce by squeezing the juice from the other half of the lemon and combining
  in a cup with the sugar and water. Stir well.
  Combine about 1 teaspoon cornstarch and about 2 teaspoon water in a second
  cup.  This mixture will be used later to thicken the lemon sauce.  Dip each
  piece of chicken in the batter and let the excess drip back into the bowl.
  Deep fry the chicken in small batches.  It is best to use an electric deep
  fryer, but if this is not available, heat about 1 quart of vegetable oil in
  a wok or deep pan until it is very hot. Then add about 5 pieces of chicken
  at a time to the oil and cook, covered, for about 5 minutes or until a
  golden brown crust forms. Check once a minute to see if the pieces are
  sticking together, and if so, separate them. After each batch is finished,
  set aside on a paper towel to drain off the excess oil.
  Cook the lemon sauce by pouring the lemon-sugar mixture into a saucepan and
  bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-water mixture and stir until
  thickened.
  To please the eye as well as the palate, mix up the chicken and colored
  pepper pieces and pile on a plate. Top with sprigs of parsley and place the
  lemon slices around the outside of the plate. Put the hot lemon sauce in a
  cup so that people can pour it over their chicken just before eating, to
  keep it crispy.
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  A nice-looking dish for company.  The deep-fried chicken pieces can also be
  served as party snacks instead of junk food.
  NOTES:
  *  Crispy chunks of chicken in sweet lemon sauce.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  : Difficulty:  With an electric deep fryer, easy; without one, moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the batter ingredients.

  *  A quick and easy chicken with cheese and marinara -- This is the
  quickest chicken recipe I know. It's especially great for working parents,
  although I've used it for entertaining guests, as well. I don't remember
  where I got it from. Actually, I think I made it up!
  *  If you prefer, this can be prepared using boned chicken, in which case
  you should shorten the cooking time to 25 minutes.

      Title: QUICK MACADAMIA CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
      1    Garlic clove, pressed
      4    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/4 t  Dill
    1/2    Sweet red pepper
    1/4 lb Green beans (optional)
      1 lg Tomato
    1/8 lb Macadamia nuts
      4 T  Honey
    1/8 t  Sesame seeds
           Sesame oil
  Slice or chop all ingredients.  Saute the garlic in the sesame oil, until
  just fragrant. Add the dill and the chicken, and saute for about five
  minutes. Add the green beans and the red pepper; saute for another couple
  of minutes. Add the tomato and the macadamia nuts; saute another minute or
  two.  Add the honey and the sesame seeds. Continue cooking just long enough
  to warm the honey.
  NOTES:
  *  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised this
  recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and it's very quick.
  *  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken broth
  when cooking the couscous.
  *  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about 1/4 t
  arrowroot, or some cornstarch.

 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
      3    Chicken breasts, halved,
           -boned, skinned (6 halves,
           -about 3 lb in all)
      2 T  Butter (or margarine)
      1 T  Orange marmalade (I suggest
           -fresh coarsely-grated
           -orange peel)
    1/4 t  Tarragon, crumbled
    1/3 c  White wine, dry
      1    Green onion,
           -thinly sliced (use
           -part of the top)
      1 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(try red grapes,
           -such as "Flame")
    1/4 c  Cream, whipping
           Salt
           Nutmeg
  Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg.  Brown lightly in heated
  butter in a large frying pan. Add marmalade, tarragon, green onion and
  wine. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  Add grapes, cover again and continue cooking about 10 minutes longer, until
  chicken is cooked through (test with a small, sharp knife in thickest
  part).
  Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving dish;
  keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling, stirring, and cook
  until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to taste. Pour sauce over
  chicken.
  NOTES:
  *  Chicken in wine with grapes and orange -- This recipe was originally
  posted by Wayne Thompson. I thought it was great, and I submit it here with
  some variations. This colors in this dish are a feast for the eyes. The
  recipe comes originally from "Elegant Meals with Inexpensive Meats," by
  Ortho Books. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  *  (WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.
  *  (CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan; I skip the
  cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful black-green-red-orange-tan
  colors.
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.

           -skin intact)
      3    Lemons
      1 md Onion, chopped
     12 oz Beer
      4 oz Soy sauce
      1    Garlic clove,
           -mashed or chopped
  Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
  preparing the rest of the marinade.
  In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and chopped
  garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.
  Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours minimum.
  It's better to marinate overnight.  Make sure chicken is covered by
  marinade.
  Over an OPEN outdoor grill (gas or charcoal), cook the chicken for about 40
  minutes turning every 10 minutes or so.  Each time the chicken is turned,
  re- dip the pieces in the marinade.

  *  Easy marinated chicken for outdoor BBQ -- This recipe was obtained from
  a friend of a friend several years ago. It has been a hit every time and is
  guaranteed to have your downwind neighbors salivating at your doorstep.
  Yield:  serves 2-4.
  *  More chicken may be added to this recipe; the only limiting factor is
  that the chicken be covered with the marinade while in the refrigerator.
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes to prepare marinade, overnight in refrigerator, 40
  minutes to cook.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH CHIPPED BEEF AND BACON
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
      8    Chicken breast halves
           -(4 whole breasts)
      4 oz Chipped beef
           -(1 package)
      8 sl Bacon
     13 oz Mushroom soup
           -concentrate (e.g.
           -1 can Campbell's soup)
      1 c  Sour cream
  Cut chipped beef into strips.  Line the baking pan with them.
  Wrap bacon around chicken.  Put in pan on top of beef.
  Mix soup and sour cream.  Pour mixture over chicken.  Cover tightly and
  refrigerate overnight, or at least several hours.  It comes out better if
  you do it overnight.
  Bake in 275 degree F. oven, uncovered, for three hours.
  NOTES:
  *  Succulent and easy chicken -- This recipe makes the most succulent and
  juicy chicken I've had.  It is very easy to make.  The only drawback is
  that you have to start the night before you want to serve it. It would be a
  good recipe for when you have company, since you can do most of the work
  the previous day.
  *  A note on ingredients for non-US cooks:  "chipped beef" is cooked spiced
  beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches.  A worthy
  substitute is  roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned lightly with salt
  and pepper. A "can of mushroom soup," such as Campbell's soup, is 1 1/2
  cups of double-strength cream soup concentrate. You can substitute the
  Knorr Swiss dried mushroom soup mix (available worldwide) if you make it
  with a mixture of milk and water. Use 1/2 of a 70-gram package of soup mix
  with 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk. Cook the soup according to package
  directions, then let cool.

      Title: CHICKEN KORMA
 Categories: Poultry, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
      4    Chicken breast
           -halves, boned
    1/2 c  Safflower oil
    1/4 c  Butter, clarified
           -(the Indians call
           -this stuff "ghee")
      6 md Yellow onions
      3    Cloves garlic, fresh
  1 1/2 t  Ginger (use fresh
           -ginger if you can
           -find it)
     20    Cloves, whole
     12    Green cardamom seeds,
           -whole, cracked
           -(or less; or use 2 t
           -of ground cardamom)
      5    Bay leaves
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Coriander (ground)
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
           -(or more to taste)
      8 oz Yogurt, plain
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Milk
  Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces and set aside.  Peel the
  onions and chop them fine. You should have about 3 cups of onion. Mince the
  garlic and add to the bowl of chopped onions.
  In a big frypan that has a lid, heat the butter and oil, then saute the
  onions and garlic for about 10 minutes, until the first hint of browning.
  Use "medium-high" heat.
  Crack the cardamom seeds between your fingers, just to get the shell open.
  Add them to the pan.  Add the ginger, cloves, bay leaves and salt.  Saute
  until the onions are nice and brown, about 5 more minutes.
  Mix the coriander and red pepper with the yogurt.  Add the yogurt to the
  frypan, stirring as you pour, slowly enough that the onion doesn't stop
  bubbling.  It could take several minutes to do this, depending on the
  diameter of your frypan. When the last of the yogurt dries up, add the
  chicken pieces and brown them. Add 1/2 cup water, reduce heat, cover and
  simmer 20 minutes.
  Stir in the milk and turn off the heat.  It needs to sit a few minutes to
  let the flavors blend. The longer you let it sit after cooking, the better
  it will taste (up to several hours).
  While the chicken is sitting, cook some rice.  I make saffron rice to go
  with this dish.
  Fish out the bay leaves and as many of the whole cloves as you can find,
  before serving.  Americans don't seem to like to eat whole cloves in their
  food.  Check to make sure it is moist enough (it should have the
  consistency of applesauce). Reheat over low heat. Serve.
  NOTES:
  *  Indian braised chicken with onions, cloves and ginger -- I learned to
  like Indian food in London, where delicious Indian food can be had in
  simple restaurants at hamburger prices and the fare at fancy places ranks
  among the finest food on Earth. Back in America, to satisfy my new craving
  for good Indian food I had to learn to cook it myself. This is a
  Friday-night supper dish in our family, too complex for a weekday meal, and
  too plain to serve to company.
  Indian food is often quite elaborate, so by their standards this is a fast
  and simple dish. It is a classical Indian recipe, found in many cookbooks.
  *  Indians put a lot more salt in their cooking than this recipe calls for;
  if you want to make it more authentic you should double the salt. Indians
  also don't like chicken skin and will go to great lengths to prevent even
  small pieces of chicken skin from getting into the food. I rather like
  chicken skin myself, and I don't try very hard to keep it out of this dish.
  *  If you can't find green cardamom seeds, don't bother using white ones,
  they've been bleached and processed and don't have much flavor left.  Use
  ground cardamom instead.

      1 T  Coriander seeds, ground
    1/2 t  Turmeric, ground
      2 lb Chicken breast
           -(boneless), cut into
           -bite-sized pieces
      8 oz Tomato sauce
    1/2 lb New potatoes,
           -peeled and quartered
  Grind cumin seeds, black pepper, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black mustard
  seeds and fenugreek seeds together in a spice grinder. In a small bowl,
  combine ground spices, vinegar, salt, cayenne pepper and brown sugar. Set
  aside.
  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Fry onions, stirring
  frequently, until they are a rich, dark brown. Remove onions with a slotted
  spoon and put them in a blender. Turn off the heat, but do not discard the
  oil.  Add about 3 T water (or more if necessary) to the onions and blend
  until you have a smooth paste. Add this onion paste to the spices in the
  bowl.  This mixture is the vindaloo paste.
  Put the ginger and garlic in a blender.  Add about 3 T water and blend
  until you have a smooth paste.
  Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan over medium heat.  When hot, add the
  ginger, garlic paste.  Stir until the paste browns slightly.  Add the
  coriander and turmeric.  Stir a few seconds.  Add the chicken, a little at
  a time, and brown lightly.
  Add the vindaloo paste, tomato sauce and potatoes to the chicken in the
  saucepan.  Stir and bring to a slight boil.  Cover the saucepan, reduce
  heat to low and simmer for about an hour, or until potatoes are tender.
  Serve over rice.
  NOTES:
  *  Spicy chicken curry -- Nearly every Indian restaurant serves something
  that it calls Chicken Vindaloo, but the dish varies greatly from place to
  place. This recipe is a modification of a vindaloo recipe that appears in
  Madhur Jaffrey's "Indian Cooking" (Barron's 1983). I've attempted to
  approximate the Chicken Vindaloo served at The Tandoor Palace on Second
  Avenue in New York. Yield: serves 4-6.
  *  Don't undercook the onions.  They should be cooked until dark brown.  If
  the onion paste turns out gray rather than brown, then the onions were not
  cooked enough.
  *  This dish is very, very hot.  It may not seem so at first, but the
  spices have a cumulative effect that builds up over the course of the meal.

  pressing on the chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula, for about 4
  minutes per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink
  inside (cut to check).  Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm.

  water over high heat, stirring occasionally (about 1 to 2 minutes for fresh
