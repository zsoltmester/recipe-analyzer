Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to drain   most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and slightly   browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3 minutes. Add the   rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the chicken stock to keep the   rice from sticking.     Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the almonds   and serve immediately.     Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I very   often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With cooked   vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and add them just   early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not to use vegetables   that will become mushy with the heating, you will want them to still be   tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli, even spinach. If you are   having Denise Bradshaw over to dinner, throw in a few peas.

2    Boneless chicken breasts       1 bn Baby carrots       1 bn Coriander (cilantro)       2 tb Best quality olive oil       1 ts Lemon juice     Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.  Lay   each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with the palm   of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the sides of the   paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible, and roll up to   make a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with foil to make a   waterproof package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.  Measure the olive oil   into a small saucepan and add a seasoning of salt and pepper.  Coarsely   chop a tablespoon or two of coriander leaves (a little less for beginners,   a little more for addicts) and reserve separately.  All these preparations   can be done well ahead.       About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.   Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into a   large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending on the   size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the surface of the   liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels, still wrapped up,   to a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.       Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.  Warm   the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2 tablespoons of the   juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly carve the breasts into   thin slices and arrange the meat beside the carrots.  Add the lemon juice   to the hot olive oil and immediately pour the sizzling mixture over the   chicken and carrots.  Scatter with chopped coriander and serve straightway   with hot crusty bread to mop up the juices.

Toss in a bowl   with the parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper.   Loosen the chicken skin and stuff about 2 teaspoons garlic mixture between   the skin and the meat.  Reserve remaining garlic mixture.  Set chicken   aside.   Prepare hot coals in a grill.  When the coals are ready, grill the chicken   5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until the flesh is no longer pink.  Do not   overcook the chicken or it will become dry.   Heat the butter in a skillet, add the reserved garlic mixture, and saute a   few seconds.  Add the lemon juice and adjust seasonings.  Heat through.   Place the chicken on a large heated platter and spoon the garlic sauce   over it.

It is a much more beautiful presentation and it   keeps the chicken moist. Bones can be used to make stock or discarded. If   you prefer, or can only obtain skinless chicken, then make a cut on the   bottom of each breast the length of the breast to form a pocket. Stuff each   breast with same amount of filling and turn slit side down. Brush top with   a film of Dijon mustard and continue with recipe. To heighten mushroom   flavour, add one 10g package of soaked dried mushrooms along with the   regular mushrooms, if desired. Dried currents may be substituted for   cranberries. Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Heat butter in skillet on   medium high heat. Add onion, saute until softened the add mushrooms and   zucchini. Saute until all liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally,   about 10 minutes. Stir in tarragon and cream. Continue to cook until cream   has reduced and mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and   add enough breadcrumbs to hold mixture together. Add parsely and season   well with salt and pepper. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.   With fingertips, make a pocket between skin and flesh of each chicken   breast. Stuff about 1/3 c filling under skin, tucking skin around breast to   enclose stuffing. Place chicken breasts in large oiled (preferably metal)   baking dish or roasting pan. Dot with butter, refrigerate until one hour   before baking. Baking in 400F (200C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until   juices run clear. If skin is not quite crisp enough, place under broiler to   crisp it. While chicken is baking, place sauce ingredients in pot and bring   to boil over medium high heat. Reduce by half, skimming occasionally, about   25 minutes. Over low heat, whisk in butter, 1 tb at a time, until sauce is   slightly thickened and glossy. Just before serving, skim any fat off pan   juices and add juices to sauce. Either slice chicken breasts into 1/4 inch   slices before serving and coat with sauce or serve chicken breasts whole   and place sauce in sauce boat. Garnish with extra dried cranberries, if   desired.  
4    Bacon strips       2    Chicken breast halves            - with skin and bones     1/2 c  Soy sauce     1/4 c  Sugar       2    Garlic cloves; minced   1 1/2 ts Ginger; ground     1/2 ts Paprika       2 dr Hot pepper sauce (or 3)     Wrap two bacon strips around each chicken breast; place in a shallow   glass baking dish and set aside.  In a small mixing bowl, combine soy   sauce and sugar; add remaining ingredients.  Pour over chicken,   turning to coat evenly.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for   several hours or overnight.  Drain and reserve marinade.  Bake at   325F for 50-60 minutes or until chicken tests done, basting   occasionally with marinade.  
12    Chicken breasts, boned     1/2 c  Peanut butter     1/8 c  Honey       1 ts Cumin       1 tb Mint, dried       1 pk G. Washington's Golden            -bouillon mix     Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as   possible. (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any   knifework I've tried to date.)  Pull off shreds and gobbets.   Put peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.   Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to   mix.   Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over each   piece of breast meat.  Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on the   breast and roll them up into a packet.  Tie the packet shut with   butcher's twine or fasten with a toothpick.   Arrange the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful   not to let any fall open.   Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and mix   well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets.   Add water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch.   Turn crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours.   Remove packets from pot and let drain on a platter.   All the chicken fat will have migrated to the top of the liquid,   which I suspect would probably make a wonderful flavoring for soups   and other dishes.

If possible, do this the day before you cook the gumbo.  Next slice sausage   into 1/4-to-1/2 inch pieces.        Make roux, using a cast iron or very heavy skillet that is very clean.   Place oil in skillet over high heat - oil should be at stage where it just   begins to smoke - and gradually stir in flour, using a long-handled spoon.        Roux will take about 3 to 4 minutes to cook and must be stirred   constantly so that it does not burn.  If you see black specks in the roux,   it has burned and you must start over again.        As you make the roux, it will change in color from cream to tan to brown   and then to dark red-brown.  Remove from heat.  Stir in onions, green   peppers and celery, stirring constantly until roux stops getting darker.   Bring to stove once more, and cook over low heat about five to seven   minutes, stirring constantly.        In a large dutch oven, bring 6 c of water to a boil, and add the roux,   stirring to dissolve it thoroughly.  Carefully add chicken and cook about   30 to 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Remove chicken, and   set aside to cool.  Debone chicken, and cut into bite-size pieces.        Add sausage, 1 c water, 1 ts black pepper and chopped garlic and cayenne   to the pot, and simmer for 35 to 45 minutes, uncovered, stirring   frequently.  Taste, and add salt, if necessary.  Stir in the chicken, and   remove the gumbo from the heat.  skim surface to remove fat that sausage   gives off during cooking.        Serve over rice with a tossed salad and French bread.

Toss noodles with 1/2 t oil to prevent   sticking. Cover & refrigerate until ready to use.      Chicken:  Remove and discard skin from chicken breast. Steam breast for 15   minutes; remove from steamer and cool uncovered. Shred chicken with   fingers; slice into 3" strips.      Egg Yolks:  Mix yolks with cool water. Brush skillet at medium heat with   peanut oil.  Pour some egg yolk mixture in skillet; spread to make a thin   sheet; remove when egg is set. Repeat until egg is used. Cool egg sheets.   Slice into thin strips to match chicken shreds.      Onions:  Wash & remove roots. Slice the long way, then thinly slice on the   bias.      Dressing:  Mix soy, vinegar, chili oil, ginger juice, garlic & sugar. Heat   oil until it begins to smoke; add to other ingredients. Cool.

Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan.   Reserve.      Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat into   1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold   chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single   chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk). Stir chicken pieces into egg   mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut flour   gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be   substituted.      Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll   need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a light tan   color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts with   strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.      Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should   raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated   chicken chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a   time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they are   frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.      Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green onions &   peanuts about a minute before serving. At the last minute, add chicken   pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

Heat grill or broiler and cook chicken until done (approx. 5 minutes on   each side).  Cool to reoom temperature and shred inot 1/4-inch peices. 2.

Published in Chicago Tribune Magaine 11/14/93.      [Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see that   nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices -- other   than the chili powder (which was not listed in the "ingredients,"   originally -- I had to go back and insert that)  or what to do with the   vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices in the cooking oil and   smear it over the chicken breast before grilling or broiling. Suggestions,   of course, will be appreciated.  Complaints will be ignored.]      Posted in the Cooking echo by Bud Cloyd (in a valiant, yet possibly futile   attempt to keep out of trouble with the moderator)

1 kg Chicken Breasts       4 lg Eggs       2 c  Flour       2 c  Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)     All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and Australian   currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in half as   described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs about $10 to   serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed potato and mini   carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first Recipe so here goes.      Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet to beat   chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim any skin or get   skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories.      Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second   plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread crumbs   on it.      Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg either   by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs and put on   plate.      On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so that   the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is very   soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the cooking for the   family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or what but they taste   best that way.Just cook them and when the look cooked cut in half and if   the meat is white(like chicken sould look not the colour of an uncooked   fillet) they are cooked.I cook on medium heat in a frypan with some oil.   Serving Suggestions: In the Colder months this meal is best served with   Mashed potato and gravy as well as carrots and any other vegetables you   like.      In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the   lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin pineapple   ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a filling and   tasty meal.      Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated. CYA!

Mix soy, oil, honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a   shallow dish just large enough to hold the chicken in one close layer.   Marinate the chicken in this mixture for 1 hour at room temperature or for   several hours the refrigerator, turning several times.  Grill the chicken   breasts for 3 to 4 minutes per side, the tenderloins about 2 minutes per   side.  The chicken may also be sauteed over moderate heat in a skillet   lightly filmed with oil.  The bottom of the skillet will darken as the   honey caramelizes but is easily cleaned.      Cut the breasts in thick slices and fan on dinner plates, placing the   tenderloins along side.  Spoon the salsa over the top and drizzle with the   mayonnaise.      MANGO SALSA      Slice the mango flesh from each side of the pit.  One half at a time, make   an inch cut just inside the skin, then score the flesh in 3/8-inch cubes.   Turn skin inside out and free the mango flesh with the knife. Cut the cubes   in inch dice, reserving any mushy pieces for some other use. You should end   up with about 1 1/2 cups. Combine mango with all remaining ingredients and   let sit 30 minutes to blend flavor.      **  Note:  1 1/2 Cups peach or papaya dice may be substituted for the   mango.

Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their   flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a   knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink shoots.   Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the flavor will not   be quite the same.      Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime   leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling.  Add the chicken, fish   sauce and sugar.      Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked .  Add the   remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.      Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the soup   into the serving bowl.      Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and serve.

12 oz Canned coconut milk            -- such as Chaokoh     1/4 lb Chicken breast            -- cut into small chunks       1    Lime; juice and grated peel       1    4" piece of lemon grass            -- cut into very thin            -- (1/16") slices on the            -- diagonal       3 sl Galanga (more if desired)            --OR substitute fresh ginger            Hot chile peppers to taste            -- cut into thin circles            Cilantro for garnish     * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,   (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).      Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let   stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place   the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and   (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole   dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the   hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.      When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to   distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and   cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.   Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for   garnish.      Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper   instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,   and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds. We also served it   over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who   cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any   tender, delicate white fish ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or   maybe little chunks of monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as   well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I   recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,   very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian   grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that   Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)      Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available   in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it   frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or   the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok   for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)      2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could   barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild. I like it   in the middle.      3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can   tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,   I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the   slices of lemon grass and ginger.

Remove chicken from the wok and set aside.      Add remaining 2 TBL oil to the wok. When oil is hot, add celery, beans,   carrot, and garlic. Stir fry 1 minute. Add water. Cover and cook for 3   minutes or until veggies are just tender-crisp.      Return chicken and chicken broth mixture to pan. Stir until liquid boils   and thickens (about 1 minute). Stir in most of the cashews. Garnish with   the remaining cashews.      This recipe is from Sunset "WOK Cook Book" and is a delightful stir fry.

-Spice mixture:     1/4 ts White pepper     1/4 ts Red pepper     1/2 ts Black pepper     1/2 ts Thyme       1 ts Dry parsley flakes     1/2 ts Gumbo file powder            -(optional)            -Vegetables:       2 c  Onion       2 c  Green pepper       2 c  Celery            -meats:       2    Smoked chicken breasts.      12    Inches pepperoni.            -broth:       6 c  Chicken broth     Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut rest in   fine chop (or use food processor).      Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and pulled   into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked chicken, you may   get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke. I would guess no more   than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches) pepperoni, cut into   moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about twice as thick as presliced   pizza pepperoni usually is)      Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and   singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,   stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for about   5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add spice mixture   and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry roux. Add the broth   and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to medium low and simmer for at   least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender and flavors are merged. About   5 minutes before serving, add the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture.   At the same time, add more roux to thicken if desired.      Serve in bowl over lots of rice.      For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese   cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni. Remove   all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken pieces.                   -Spice mixture:     1/4 ts White pepper     1/4 ts Red pepper     1/2 ts Black pepper     1/2 ts Thyme       1 ts Dry parsley flakes     1/2 ts Gumbo file powder            -(optional)            -Vegetables:       2 c  Onion       2 c  Green pepper       2 c  Celery            -meats:       2    Smoked chicken breasts.      12    Inches pepperoni.            -broth:       6 c  Chicken broth     Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut rest in   fine chop (or use food processor).      Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and pulled   into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked chicken, you may   get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke. I would guess no more   than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches) pepperoni, cut into   moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about twice as thick as presliced   pizza pepperoni usually is)      Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and   singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,   stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for about   5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add spice mixture   and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry roux. Add the broth   and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to medium low and simmer for at   least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender and flavors are merged. About   5 minutes before serving, add the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture.   At the same time, add more roux to thicken if desired.      Serve in bowl over lots of rice.      For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese   cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni. Remove   all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken pieces.         ==  Courtesy of Dale & Gail Shipp, Columbia Md.  === Converted by MMCONV   vers. 1.50

These butter-flour balls can be   made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the refrigerator for 1   or 2 weeks.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a small flat plate   and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth paste. Roll the paste   into a ball. In a small skillet, heat 2 T of butter. Add the scallions and   cook for 2 or 3 minutes without browning.  Add the mushrooms. Season with   salt and pepper and cook the mixture over high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes   to brown the mushrooms lightly. Reserve. Season the chicken breasts with   salt and pepper and sprinkle them with lemon juice. In a large chicken   fryer, melt the remaining butter. When it is quite hot, add the chicken   breasts and cook them for 1 minute on each side.  Cover the pan with   buttered wax paper and then the pan lid.  Lower the heat and simmer the   chicken breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the juices run out   pale yellow when pierced with a fork. Do not overcook or pierce every   piece.  Immediately remove the chicken breasts to a serving platter. Pour   the chicken stock into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the stock until   it is almost a glaze. Add the heavy cream and continue cooking over high   heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the sauce heavily coats a spoon.   Add the chives and correct the seasoning.
