  Hugo Arnold's Commentary Follows.
  
  THAI food seems to have erupted into British life over the past few
  years, particularly in pubs, where many have ditched sausages and chips
  for Nam Tok, Tom Yam Gung or Grat Doo Moo Nueng Dow Jeow - the latter
  being Thai spare ribs. Alongside this explosion runs the increasing
  availability of the ingredients necessary to produce these dishes -
  lemon grass, kaffir lime, galangal and a few cookery books to explain
  the process.
  
  Vatcharin Bhumichitr wants us not only to cook Thai food, but to
  understand it. His latest book, Vatch's Thai Cookbook (Pavilion 17.99),
  groups recipes and writings under different ingredient headings. This
  approach, he hopes, will enable readers to appreciate the subtleties and
  origins of this intrinsically delicate cuisine. Mr Bhumichitr owns
  Chiang Mai, a Thai restaurant in Soho that serves up the sort of food I
  remember eating in Bangkok - light, delicate, spicy and well balanced an
  aspect frequently misunderstood, but well explained in this title. His
  book is full of similar recipes. Most are remarkably quick to cook, and
  ideal for that Thursday evening when you don't really have time to cook
  a stew or casserole. Today's recipe is from the bamboo shoots section of
  the book.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP (TOM KA GAI OR KAI TOM
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let stand while you prepare the
  rest of the soup.  In a medium saucepan, place the coconut milk, lemon
  grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and (optionally) chiles.
  (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole dish to taste
  spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the hotter the
  resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
  stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
  below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
  pieces are finished cooking.  Remove from heat and serve immediately
  with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
  of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
  birds.  We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
  southeast Asian or Caribbean?  Who cares, it was wonderful.  If you
  can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
  ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
  monkfish.  I believe I've had this with shrimp as well.  (Grouper,
  BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in
  other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very
  tender, and quite delicately flavored.  I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd
  guess that Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes:
  ======
  1.  Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available in most
  Asian groceries.  If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin
  Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in
  from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
  could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
  mild.  I like it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
  can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient

      Title: CHICKEN & RED BELL PEPPER BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Pasta, Low-fat, Sauces, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped fine
      1 md Garlic clove, chopped fine
    1/2 lb Ground chicken breast
    1/2 c  Chardonnay or other dry
           - white wine
      1 cn Salt-free whole tomatoes
           - (16-ounce)
      1 tb Double-concentrate tomato
           - paste
      1 tb Fresh basil leaves, finely
           - shredded
      1 tb Fresh Italian parsley,
           - finely chopped
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh rosemary leaves,
           - finely chopped
      2 md Red bell peppers, roasted,
           -peeled, stemmed, seeded,
           -and coarsely chopped,
           -juices saved
           Cooked pasta of your choice
 
  In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil with the onion and
  garlic over moderate heat. When they sizzle, add the chicken and saute it,
  stirring and breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until it begins to
  brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
  
  Add the wine and stir and scrape well to deglaze the pan. Add the
  tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands, and stir in the remaining
  ingredients.
  
  Simmer the sauce until thick but still slightly liquid, 20 to 25 minutes.
  Spoon over cooked pasta -- spaghetti, fettuccine or medium-sized tubles,
  shells or other shapes are recommended.
  
  Directions for roasting bell peppers:
  ~-
  Place the peppers in a foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven.
  Roast until their skins are evenly blistered and browned, about 25
  minutes, turning them 2 or 3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them from
  the oven and cover them with a kitchen towel.
  
  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, pull out their stems, peel
  away their blackened skins; open the peppers up; and remove their seeds,
  using a teaspoon to pick up any stray ones.
  
  Take care not to lose any of the peppers' juices, which are also very
  flavorful. You might want to pour them through a fine mesh strainer to
  remove any seeds or bits of skin.
 

 

 
      Title: CHICKEN-THYME STEW WITH SOUR CREAM
 Categories: Cyberealm, Ww, Poultry, Mom's best, Kooknet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     15 oz Boneless chicken breasts
      1 tb + 1 tsp olive oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2 cl Garlic, minced
      1 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Chopped parsley
  1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Chicken seasoning(I added)
      1 oz (2 T) dry sherry
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Nonfat sour cream
 
  1. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. In a large nonstick skillet,
  over medium high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until hot but not
  smoking. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until browned, about 3-5
  minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.
  
  2. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion
  and garlic, and cook, stirring until the onion begins to brown (3-5
  minutes). Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is no
  longer visible, about 30 seconds.
  
  3. Add the mushrooms, chicken broth, parsley, sherry, thyme, and
  pepper, and bring to a boil, stirring, until the mixture has
  thickened slightly. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until
  heated through, about 1 minute.
  
  4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream.
  
  NOTE: You can make this ahead of time, reserving the addition of the
  sour cream just before you serve it. I served this over cooked egg
  noodles, with French bread and chunky applesauce, and it was GREAT!

      Title: STEAMED ANISE CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Limes
      1 tb Brown sugar
      4    Star anise, divided (see
           Note)
    1/8 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
    1/3 c  Water
      4    Boneless and skinless
           Chicken breast halves
 
  1. Squeeze the juice out of the limes.  Reserve the peels.  Measure 3
     tablespoons juice.
  
  2. In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, brown sugar, 2 star anise,
     crushed red pepper, soy sauce and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the
     heat and simmer 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.
  
  3. Put the chicken in a glass dish and spoon half of the soy mixture over,
     turning to coat.  Marinate at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and
     refrigerate for longer marination, up to 24 hours.
  
  4. When ready to steam the chicken, put the lime peels, 2 star anise and
     about 8 cups of water into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Fit a
     steamer basket or rack over the top.  Remove the chicken from the
     marinade, discarding the leftover marinade, and place in the steamer.
     Cover tightly and steam about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is no
     longer pink in the center.
  
  5. In a small saucepan cook down the remaining soy mixture until reduced
     to about 2 tablespoons.  (You can add a little water if you reduce the
     mixture too much.)  Spoon over the steamed chicken.
  
  Note: Star anise is a dried spice with a pungent, licorice flavour.  It
  can be purchased at most Asian groceries.  You can substitute 1/2 teaspoon
  lightly crushed anise seed for 2 star anise, although the flavour will not
  be as distinctive.

  Cut boned chicken into 1/2 squares; place in a bowl and sprinkle with half
  the garlic salt, half the sherry and half the cornstarch. Cut the peeled
  shrimp into pieces 1" long.  Put them in a bowl with the rest of the garlic
  salt, sherry and cornstarch.
  
  Heat 2 T oil over high heat in a wok or large pan.  Add onions and celery
  and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Add soy sauce; reduce heat to medium, cover
  and steam one minute.  Add mushrooms, cover and steam 2 more minutes.
  Remove mixture to a large bowl.
  
  Add remaining oil to wok, reduce heat to low and add ginger and garlic.
  Brown lightly, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Add chicken and
  shrimp.  Stir-fry two minutes, or until shrimp are pink and opaque.
  
  Add cooked rice, onion mixture and ham.  Stir until hot.  Remove from heat,
  put into a storage container and chill overnight. When ready to serve,
  reheat in a wok or large pot.  Stir in snow peas and cook two minutes. Make
  a well in the center of the wok and stir in the beaten eggs. Stir them as
  they cook, about 3 minutes, so they scramble and mix with the other
  ingredients. Cover and cook over medium heat another couple of minutes.
  Serve at once.
  
  Serves 12 as part of a family style Chinese dinner, or 4 as a main dish.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  When Cathe originally gave me this recipe in the mid 70's it called for
  just 3/4 cup shrimp (1/2 pound), 1/2 cup each diced onion and celery, 1/2
  cup boiled ham (1/4 lb), 1/2 cup peas (cooked just tender), 3 eggs and
  sprouts. Also, just 1 clove garlic, which was heated with the ginger
  (discarded when brown) before cooking the chicken.
  *  I like to add 1/2 c red bell pepper (diced) for color.

      Title: SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE ROUGE ET VERT
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Chicken breast,
           -whole

----MARINADE----
           Juice of 1 lime
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 t  Ginger
      1    Garlic clove,
           -finely chopped
      1 pn Tarragon

SAUCE
           Juice of 1 lime
      3 oz White wine
           Butter (salted)
      3 oz Tomato paste
 
  Mix the marinade ingredients.  Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2
  supremes, and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Reserve bones.
  
  Cook a bouillon using the bones.  You will need about 3 oz of bouillon.
  
  Drain, flatten and flour the supremes.  Saute quickly in clarified butter,
  about two minutes on each side.  Remove and keep warm.
  
  Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste and bouillon.
  Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much. Remove from heat
  and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter. If you remove the sauce too soon, it
  will be too soupy. The sauce should be cinnamon-coloured and shiny. There
  will be very little sauce, you may need a rubber scraper to get it out of
  the pan.
  
  Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.
  
  Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients.  I have just
  strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that.  Wear a raincoat
  when making the sauce.  It splatters.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce -- This recipe was originally
  posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax. The French name
  means "boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce." I like it a lot.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  30 minutes marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CURRY CHICKEN WITH GRAPES
 Categories: Poultry, Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8    Chicken breast
           -halves (boned)
      6 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(or less; vary amount
           -to taste)
      2 c  Mayonnaise
      4 t  Curry powder
      3 t  Olive oil
      1 t  Cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
      1 t  Fruit vinegar
 
  Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken and
  the grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into the sauce and
  then eating it).
  
  Broil the chicken breasts (3-5 minutes on each side in a preheated
  broiler), then dice or shred into small bite-sized pieces.
  
  Mix chopped chicken with about 2 cups of whole grapes.  Cover with the
  sauce. Add more grapes to taste. My taste is to add vast quantities of
  grapes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken fruit salad curry -- One day I was invited to a beach picnic,
  and asked to bring a salad. A friend and I got together in his kitchen and
  concocted a curried chicken salad with grapes.  It was delicious, but we
  forgot to write down the recipe.  After some more experimentation, I have
  come up with this recipe. I don't know if it is the same as what we made
  that day at the beach, but it is delicious.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes including cooking the chicken.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: STIR-FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Stir-fry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
     12    Mushrooms (white)
    1/2 lb Broccoli, fresh
           -(or 1 pk frozen)
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      2 T  Soy sauce
      2 T  Sherry
      1 T  Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower oil
           -is good, too)
    1/2 t  Cornstarch
      6 oz Bamboo shoots, canned
           -(optional)
      6 oz Cashew nuts, broken
           -into large pieces
 
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.  Wash and slice the
  mushrooms.  If using fresh broccoli, wash and cut it up into bite-sized
  pieces.  If using frozen broccoli, heat it or partially thaw it first.
  
  Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry and about 1 T cornstarch.  Stir
  well and set aside.
  
  Combine beaten egg white, salt, about 1/2 t oil and about 2 t cornstarch.
  Add the chicken cubes to the mixture and stir until the chicken is
  well-coated. In a wok or deep cast iron pan, heat about 3 T vegetable oil
  until hot. Add the chicken pieces in small batches and stir continuously
  until golden brown. After each batch is finished, remove and drain. Add oil
  sparingly as needed.
  
  Stir fry the mushrooms in the wok.  Stir fry the broccoli in the wok.
  Combine the chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, bamboo shoots and cashew nuts in
  the wok. Stir fry to get everything warm again. Add the bouillon-cornstarch
  sauce and stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese stir-fried chicken with broccoli and nuts.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  *  Bamboo shoots are available in cans at Chinese grocery stores.  Fresh
  broccoli is preferable to frozen, and it should be stir-fried for only a
  few minutes to keep it crunchy. Endless variations of this basic recipe are
  possible.  Beef, pork, or other lean meats can be substituted for the
  chicken. Tofu cubes or brown beans can be used to make this a vegetarian
  recipe. Chopped almonds can be used instead of cashews. Water chestnuts are
  a delightful addition. Green or red bell peppers can be used instead of
  broccoli.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: EASY SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
      1 t  Ginger, chopped
      1    Egg white
    1/2 t  Salt
      2 t  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower is
           -good, too)
      1    Green (bell) pepper
      6    Carrots
     12 oz Pineapple chunks, canned
           -(drained, but reserve
           -about 1/2 cup of
           -the juice)
           SAUCE
      2 t  Sherry
      2 t  Light soy sauce
      1 T  Vinegar
      1 t  Sugar
      1 T  Cornstarch
      1 t  Salt
 
  Cut up the chicken into bite-sized chunks.  Combine ginger, egg white,
  about 1/2 teaspoons each salt and cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon oil. Add
  the chicken chunks and stir until the chicken is well-coated.
  
  Wash green pepper.  Discard seeds and stem.  Cut into strips about 1 x 1/4
  inches.  Peel carrots.  If they are thick, cut in half lengthwise.  Cut
  diagonally into pieces about 1 inch long.  Cook the carrots in boiling
  water for 3-5 minutes, depending how crunchy you like your carrots.
  
  Drain pineapple chunks, saving about 1/2 cup of the juice.  Prepare the
  sweet and sour sauce by mixing sherry, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, reserved
  pineapple juice, about 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon salt.
  Stir well and set aside.
  
  Heat about 3 tablespoon of oil very hot in a wok or deep cast iron pan.
  Peanut oil is best since it has a high smoking point.  Stir-fry the chicken
  by putting a small batch (e.g., 5 pieces) of the cubed chicken in the wok
  and stirring continuously until golden brown. Remove to a dish. Repeat
  until all the chicken has been cooked, adding small amounts of oil as it
  gets used up.
  
  Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in an empty wok.  Stir fry the parboiled
  carrots and the green pepper for 30 seconds. Add the chicken and the
  pineapple chunks to the vegetables in the wok. Stir 1 minute or until well
  mixed and reheated. Add sweet and sour sauce to wok. Stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  I serve this recipe to company all the time and am amazed
  at how many people don't realize that you can cook Chinese food at home. It
  is always a big hit. The recipe works equally well with lean pork, tofu
  cubes, or soy beans instead of the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nice Chinese dinner you can make at home -- Don't forget to start
  cooking the rice so it will be done at the same time as the chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.

  Cut the boneless chicken breast into strips about 3 x 1/2 inches.
  
  Prepare the batter by mixing in a bowl the flour, cornstarch, baking
  powder, salt, water and oil. Stir until smooth.
  
  Cut half of the lemon into thin semicircular slices.  Prepare the lemon
  sauce by squeezing the juice from the other half of the lemon and combining
  in a cup with the sugar and water. Stir well.
  
  Combine about 1 teaspoon cornstarch and about 2 teaspoon water in a second
  cup.  This mixture will be used later to thicken the lemon sauce.  Dip each
  piece of chicken in the batter and let the excess drip back into the bowl.
  
  Deep fry the chicken in small batches.  It is best to use an electric deep
  fryer, but if this is not available, heat about 1 quart of vegetable oil in
  a wok or deep pan until it is very hot. Then add about 5 pieces of chicken
  at a time to the oil and cook, covered, for about 5 minutes or until a
  golden brown crust forms. Check once a minute to see if the pieces are
  sticking together, and if so, separate them. After each batch is finished,
  set aside on a paper towel to drain off the excess oil.
  
  Cook the lemon sauce by pouring the lemon-sugar mixture into a saucepan and
  bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-water mixture and stir until
  thickened.
  
  To please the eye as well as the palate, mix up the chicken and colored
  pepper pieces and pile on a plate. Top with sprigs of parsley and place the
  lemon slices around the outside of the plate. Put the hot lemon sauce in a
  cup so that people can pour it over their chicken just before eating, to
  keep it crispy.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  
  A nice-looking dish for company.  The deep-fried chicken pieces can also be
  served as party snacks instead of junk food.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Crispy chunks of chicken in sweet lemon sauce.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  : Difficulty:  With an electric deep fryer, easy; without one, moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the batter ingredients.

      1    Garlic clove, pressed
      4    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/4 t  Dill
    1/2    Sweet red pepper
    1/4 lb Green beans (optional)

  NOTES:
  
  *  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised this
  recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and it's very quick.
  
  *  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken broth
  when cooking the couscous.
  
  *  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about 1/4 t
  arrowroot, or some cornstarch.

      Title: GREAT GRAPE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Chicken breasts, halved,
           -boned, skinned (6 halves,
           -about 3 lb in all)
      2 T  Butter (or margarine)
      1 T  Orange marmalade (I suggest
           -fresh coarsely-grated
           -orange peel)
    1/4 t  Tarragon, crumbled
    1/3 c  White wine, dry
      1    Green onion,
           -thinly sliced (use
           -part of the top)
      1 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(try red grapes,
           -such as "Flame")
    1/4 c  Cream, whipping
           Salt
           Nutmeg
 
  Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg.  Brown lightly in heated
  butter in a large frying pan. Add marmalade, tarragon, green onion and
  wine. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Add grapes, cover again and continue cooking about 10 minutes longer, until
  chicken is cooked through (test with a small, sharp knife in thickest
  part).
  
  Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving dish;
  keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling, stirring, and cook
  until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to taste. Pour sauce over
  chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken in wine with grapes and orange -- This recipe was originally
  posted by Wayne Thompson. I thought it was great, and I submit it here with
  some variations. This colors in this dish are a feast for the eyes. The
  recipe comes originally from "Elegant Meals with Inexpensive Meats," by
  Ortho Books. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  (WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.
  
  *  (CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan; I skip the
  cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful black-green-red-orange-tan
  colors.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      4    Chicken breasts
           -(leave bones and
           -skin intact)
      3    Lemons
      1 md Onion, chopped
     12 oz Beer
      4 oz Soy sauce
      1    Garlic clove,
           -mashed or chopped
 
  Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
  preparing the rest of the marinade.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and chopped
  garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.
  
  Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours minimum.
  It's better to marinate overnight.  Make sure chicken is covered by
  marinade.
  
  Over an OPEN outdoor grill (gas or charcoal), cook the chicken for about 40
  minutes turning every 10 minutes or so.  Each time the chicken is turned,
  re- dip the pieces in the marinade.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy marinated chicken for outdoor BBQ -- This recipe was obtained from
  a friend of a friend several years ago. It has been a hit every time and is
  guaranteed to have your downwind neighbors salivating at your doorstep.
  Yield:  serves 2-4.
  
  *  More chicken may be added to this recipe; the only limiting factor is
  that the chicken be covered with the marinade while in the refrigerator.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes to prepare marinade, overnight in refrigerator, 40
  minutes to cook.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH CHIPPED BEEF AND BACON
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Chicken breast halves
           -(4 whole breasts)
      4 oz Chipped beef
           -(1 package)
      8 sl Bacon
     13 oz Mushroom soup
           -concentrate (e.g.
           -1 can Campbell's soup)
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Cut chipped beef into strips.  Line the baking pan with them.
  
  Wrap bacon around chicken.  Put in pan on top of beef.
  
  Mix soup and sour cream.  Pour mixture over chicken.  Cover tightly and
  refrigerate overnight, or at least several hours.  It comes out better if
  you do it overnight.
  
  Bake in 275 degree F. oven, uncovered, for three hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Succulent and easy chicken -- This recipe makes the most succulent and
  juicy chicken I've had.  It is very easy to make.  The only drawback is
  that you have to start the night before you want to serve it. It would be a
  good recipe for when you have company, since you can do most of the work
  the previous day.
  
  *  A note on ingredients for non-US cooks:  "chipped beef" is cooked spiced
  beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches.  A worthy
  substitute is  roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned lightly with salt
  and pepper. A "can of mushroom soup," such as Campbell's soup, is 1 1/2
  cups of double-strength cream soup concentrate. You can substitute the
  Knorr Swiss dried mushroom soup mix (available worldwide) if you make it
  with a mixture of milk and water. Use 1/2 of a 70-gram package of soup mix
  with 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk. Cook the soup according to package
  directions, then let cool.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 day waiting, 3 hours cooking.

      Title: CHICKEN KORMA
 Categories: Poultry, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Chicken breast
           -halves, boned
    1/2 c  Safflower oil
    1/4 c  Butter, clarified
           -(the Indians call
           -this stuff "ghee")
      6 md Yellow onions
      3    Cloves garlic, fresh
  1 1/2 t  Ginger (use fresh
           -ginger if you can
           -find it)
     20    Cloves, whole
     12    Green cardamom seeds,
           -whole, cracked
           -(or less; or use 2 t
           -of ground cardamom)
      5    Bay leaves
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Coriander (ground)
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
           -(or more to taste)
      8 oz Yogurt, plain
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces and set aside.  Peel the
  onions and chop them fine. You should have about 3 cups of onion. Mince the
  garlic and add to the bowl of chopped onions.
  
  In a big frypan that has a lid, heat the butter and oil, then saute the
  onions and garlic for about 10 minutes, until the first hint of browning.
  Use "medium-high" heat.
  
  Crack the cardamom seeds between your fingers, just to get the shell open.
  Add them to the pan.  Add the ginger, cloves, bay leaves and salt.  Saute
  until the onions are nice and brown, about 5 more minutes.
  
  Mix the coriander and red pepper with the yogurt.  Add the yogurt to the
  frypan, stirring as you pour, slowly enough that the onion doesn't stop
  bubbling.  It could take several minutes to do this, depending on the
  diameter of your frypan. When the last of the yogurt dries up, add the
  chicken pieces and brown them. Add 1/2 cup water, reduce heat, cover and
  simmer 20 minutes.
  
  Stir in the milk and turn off the heat.  It needs to sit a few minutes to
  let the flavors blend. The longer you let it sit after cooking, the better
  it will taste (up to several hours).
  
  While the chicken is sitting, cook some rice.  I make saffron rice to go
  with this dish.
  
  Fish out the bay leaves and as many of the whole cloves as you can find,
  before serving.  Americans don't seem to like to eat whole cloves in their
  food.  Check to make sure it is moist enough (it should have the
  consistency of applesauce). Reheat over low heat. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian braised chicken with onions, cloves and ginger -- I learned to
  like Indian food in London, where delicious Indian food can be had in
  simple restaurants at hamburger prices and the fare at fancy places ranks
  among the finest food on Earth. Back in America, to satisfy my new craving
  for good Indian food I had to learn to cook it myself. This is a
  Friday-night supper dish in our family, too complex for a weekday meal, and
  too plain to serve to company.
  
  Indian food is often quite elaborate, so by their standards this is a fast
  and simple dish. It is a classical Indian recipe, found in many cookbooks.
  
  *  Indians put a lot more salt in their cooking than this recipe calls for;
  if you want to make it more authentic you should double the salt. Indians
  also don't like chicken skin and will go to great lengths to prevent even
  small pieces of chicken skin from getting into the food. I rather like
  chicken skin myself, and I don't try very hard to keep it out of this dish.
  
  *  If you can't find green cardamom seeds, don't bother using white ones,
  they've been bleached and processed and don't have much flavor left.  Use
  ground cardamom instead.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (timing is somewhat important)
  : Time:  1 hour plus "sitting time."
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      1 T  Coriander seeds, ground
    1/2 t  Turmeric, ground
      2 lb Chicken breast
           -(boneless), cut into
           -bite-sized pieces
      8 oz Tomato sauce
    1/2 lb New potatoes,
           -peeled and quartered
 
  Grind cumin seeds, black pepper, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black mustard
  seeds and fenugreek seeds together in a spice grinder. In a small bowl,
  combine ground spices, vinegar, salt, cayenne pepper and brown sugar. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Fry onions, stirring
  frequently, until they are a rich, dark brown. Remove onions with a slotted
  spoon and put them in a blender. Turn off the heat, but do not discard the
  oil.  Add about 3 T water (or more if necessary) to the onions and blend
  until you have a smooth paste. Add this onion paste to the spices in the
  bowl.  This mixture is the vindaloo paste.
  
  Put the ginger and garlic in a blender.  Add about 3 T water and blend
  until you have a smooth paste.
  
  Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan over medium heat.  When hot, add the
  ginger, garlic paste.  Stir until the paste browns slightly.  Add the
  coriander and turmeric.  Stir a few seconds.  Add the chicken, a little at
  a time, and brown lightly.
  
  Add the vindaloo paste, tomato sauce and potatoes to the chicken in the
  saucepan.  Stir and bring to a slight boil.  Cover the saucepan, reduce
  heat to low and simmer for about an hour, or until potatoes are tender.
  Serve over rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy chicken curry -- Nearly every Indian restaurant serves something
  that it calls Chicken Vindaloo, but the dish varies greatly from place to
  place. This recipe is a modification of a vindaloo recipe that appears in
  Madhur Jaffrey's "Indian Cooking" (Barron's 1983). I've attempted to
  approximate the Chicken Vindaloo served at The Tandoor Palace on Second
  Avenue in New York. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  Don't undercook the onions.  They should be cooked until dark brown.  If
  the onion paste turns out gray rather than brown, then the onions were not
  cooked enough.
  
  *  This dish is very, very hot.  It may not seem so at first, but the
  spices have a cumulative effect that builds up over the course of the meal.

      1 lb MUSHROOMS
    1/4 ts PEPPER, FRESHLY GROUND
    1/4 ts NUTMEG (OPTIONAL)
    1/2 c  SOUR CREAM
      5 tb BUTTER OR MARGARINE
    1/2 ts SALT
      1 tb ITALIAN SEASONING
  1 1/2 c  FRESH BREAD CRUMBS
      4    CHICKEN BREASTS
    1/2 c  CHICKEN BROTH

----ITALIAN SEASONING----
    1/4 tb OREGANO
    1/2 tb BASIL
    1/4 tb ROSEMARY
 
  The Mushrooms should finely chopped. The chicken breasts should be boned
  and skinless, halved (8 pieces) and pounded flat.  Seasoned bread crumbs
  may also be used.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 f.  Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet.
  Add the mushrooms (finely chopped), salt and pepper and cook, stiring
  often until the mushrooms turn very dark and absorb all the butter.
  Remove from the heat.  Add the Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.
  Stir in 3/4 cup of the bread crumbs and the nutmeg.
  
  Divide the mushroom stuffing into 8 portions and place a portion of the
  stuffing in the center of each piece of chicken.  Roll the chicken around
  the stuffing and place, seam side down, in a buttered shallow casserole/
  baking dish. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and brush over the
  chicken. Sprinkle with the remaining 3/4 cup of bread crumbs until all the
  pieces are covered.  Mix the sour cream with the heated chicken broth and
  pour over the chicken.  Bake for 45-60 minutes, until lightly browned.

  Snip the tomatoes into bite-size pieces.  Melt the butter in a saucepan

  stock and the tomatoes.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer,
  uncovered, over medium heat for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are
  tender.  Add the cream and bring to a boil, stirring. Simmer over medium
  heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. (The
  sauce can be kept, covered, for 1 day in the refrigerator. Heat again over
  low heat.)
  Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.  Heat the oil in a
  large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and saute,
  pressing on the chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula, for about 4
  minutes per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink
  inside (cut to check).  Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm.
  
  Discard the fat from the skillet.  Add the remaining stock and bring to a
  boil, stirring up the pan juices.  Boil to reduce slightly, then add to the
  sauce.  Stir in the basil.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.
  Meanwhile, cook the pasta, uncovered, in a large port of boiling salted
  water over high heat, stirring occasionally (about 1 to 2 minutes for fresh
  or 3 to 5 minutes for dried fettucine), or until tender but firm to the
  bite (al dente).  Drain, transfer to bowl and toss with 3 or 4 tablespoons
  of the sauce.
  Cut each chicken breasts into 2 or 3 diagonal slices.  Reheat gently in the
  sauce if needed.  Transfer the pasta to serving plates, top with the

     28 oz Can Tomatoes, drained
      6 oz Can Tomato Sauce
 
  '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Preheat oven to
  400 deg F.
   In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt. In
  another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter until it
  dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the dry ingredients
  and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a
  well-floured board and knead for a minute or so. Divide the dough into 2
  equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll out to to fit the bottom of a
  pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2 lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for
  12-15 minutes, or until dough is golden brown.
   In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining 3 T
  sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.
   Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch. Place 1
  round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top with the
  other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best served fresh
  and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly beaten heavy cream
  if you'd like.
   Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; set aside.
   Beat milk with lemon juice until thick. Fold in strawberries and whipped
  cream. Divide among crepes; fold. Garnish with additional whipped cream and
  a strawberry centered on the cream. Yields 6 servings.
   Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir until
  gelatin is completely dissolved.
   Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in berries
  and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until foamy. Fold in
  whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray. Cover with foil;
  freeze.
   NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh
  strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream maker.
  Delicious!

      1    Turkey (10 to 12 lb.)
      3 c  ;Water
      8 c  Soft breadcrumbs or
           -unseasoned croutons
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
      2 tb Poultry seasoning
      1 ts Dried whole oregano
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/3 lb Italian sausage
      4 c  Onion; chopped
      2 c  Cooking apples
           -- peeled and chopped
    2/3 c  Canned chestnuts; chopped
    1/3 c  Pine nuts
      2    Eggs; beaten
      1 ts Dried whole rosemary
           -- crushed
  1 1/2 c  Chablis or other dry white
           -wine
 
  Remove giblets and neck from turkey; rinse and place in a small
  saucepan with 3 cups water.  Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and
  simmer 30 minutes.  Remove giblets and neck from broth, reserving
  broth.  Set aside and let cool.
  
  Combine breadcrumbs and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl, stirring
  well. Set aside.
  
  Remove sausage from casing.  Cook sausage in a large skillet over high
  heat until sausage browns, stirring to crumble meat.  Remove meat
  with a slotted spoon, reserving pan drippings in skillet.  Add
  sausage to breadcrumb mixture; stir well.  Add onion to pan drippings
  in skillet; cook over medium heat until golden.  Remove with a
  slotted spoon and stir into breadcrumb mixture.  Combine apples,
  chestnuts and pine nuts.  Add to breadcrumb mixture, stirring well.
  Remove meat from reserved turkey neck; coarsely chop meat and
  giblets.  Stir meat and giblets into breadcrumb mixture.  Combine
  eggs and 1 cup reserved broth; stir well.  Pour over breadcrumb
  mixture and stir well.
  
  Rinse turkey with cold water; pat dry.  Stuff dressing into body
  cavities of turkey.  If excess skin around tail has been cut away,
  tuck legs under flap of skin around tail.  If skin is intact, close
  cavity with skewers and truss.  Tie ends of legs to tail with cord.
  Lift wingtips up and over back; tuck under bird.  Spoon remaining
  dressing into a greased 11 x 7 x 2" baking dish.  Cover and chill.
  
  Place turkey in a shallow roasting pan, breast side up; rub bird with
  crushed rosemary.  Pour wine into roasting pan around bird.  Insert
  meat thermometer in meaty part of turkey thigh, making sure
  thermometer does not touch bone.  Bake at 325 F. until meat
  thermometer reaches 185 F.  If turkey starts to brown too much, cover
  loosely with aluminum foil.
  
  When turkey is two-thirds done, cut the cord or band of skin holding
  drumstick ends to tail; this will ensure that the thighs are cooked
  internally.  Turkey is done when drumsticks are easily moved up and
  down. Let stand 15 minutes before carving.
  
  Bake remaining dressing at 350 F. for 30 to 40 minutes.
  
  Yield:  18 to 20 servings.

      Title: WHITE BEAN CHILI WITH TURKEY
 Categories: Chili, Vegetables, Salads, Beans/peas
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           chili--
      1 lb Dried white beans
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2 c  Chopped onions
      2    4 oz can diced green chilies
      6    Cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/2 tb Dried oregano; crushed
      1 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Chili powder
      7 c  Chicken broth
     18 oz Fresh or canned tomatillos
           -chopped, about 3 1/2 cups
      1 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
  1 1/2 lb Boneless skinless turkey
           -breast, cut crosswise
           -in half
      1 c  Chopped green onions
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
           cilantro cream---
    2/3 c  Plain yogurt
      3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      3 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
           -garnish-
           Fresh cilantro sprigs
    1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
 
    For chili: The recipe recommends soaking the beans overnight.
  Personally, I don't like to do that. I find the quick soak method
  works better. That is, cover beans with cold water. Bring to a boil
  and boil for 1-2 min. Turn off heat and let soak for 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain beans.  Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy Dutch oven over
  medium heat. Add chopped onion and saute 5 minutes.  Add diced
  chilies, minced garlic, oregano, cumin, and chili powder. Saute for 5
  minutes. Add beans, chicken broth, chopped tomatillos and cilantro.
  It's important that the chicken broth contain little or no salt. Salt
  inhibits the softening of the seed coat of beans. Therefore, if you
  add salt too early the beans with never soften up. Add turkey breast
  and simmer until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Transfer
  turkey to plate. Cover with foil and refrigerate. Simmer chili until
  beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.  Cut turkey into 1/2 inch pieces.
  Add turkey, green onions and lime juice to chili. Stir. Heat through.
  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  For cilantro cream: Combine yogurt, parsley, chopped cilantro in a
  medium bowl.  Ladle chili into bowls. Top with spoonful of cilantro
  cream. Sprinkle with cilantro sprigs and cheese.  Can be prepared 1
  day ahead. Cover chili and cilantro cream separately and refrigerate.
  Before serving, reheat chili over low heat.  Like most chili, it
  tastes better the second day.  From Bon Appetit September 1992

      Title: TURKEY EMPANADAS
 Categories: Turkey, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Turkey, cooked; cubed
  1 1/3 c  Cheddar; coarsely grated
      4 oz Green chiles; drained
      1 c  Flour, whole wheat
    1/4 c  Corn meal
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/4 c  ;Water, cold
      1 tb Milk
      4 ts Corn meal; for topping
 
  Mix together turkey, cheese and chilies; set aside.  In a different
  bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal and salt.  Cut in butter until
  particles are the size of small peas (a pastry blender makes this an
  easy job). Sprinkle with water and mix with pastry blender or fork
  until pastry can be formed into a ball.  Add a little more water if
  necessary. Divide dough into balls, one ball for each two servings;
  divide turkey mixture into same number as dough. Turn one dough ball
  onto floured board and roll into an 11" square. Place on oiled cookie
  sheet. Spoon one part of turkey mixture over 1/2 of pastry, coming to
  1 1/2" of the edge.  Fold other half of pastry over it, and crimp
  edges to seal them.  Repeat this procedure with each ball of dough.
  Brush turnovers with milk.  Sprinkle remaining corn meal on top. Bake
  at 400 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool
  slightly; slice into wedges to serve.

  * (use white if you prefer, but since it doesn't take as long to cook,
  you may want to cook the vegetables a bit before adding the rice.)
  
  Put rice and liquid in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add curry,
  pepper flakes, carrots, celery, leek, kale and mushrooms.  Return to a
  boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until most of
  the liquid is absorbed.  Add meat and peas, and cook another 5 minutes.
  Serve.  This served 2 very (!) hungry adults.  You could
  probably stretch it to 3 by adding a bit more rice and liquid

      9 lb To 13 lb turkey
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh sage, or:
      2 ts Dried sage, crushed
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary, or:
      2 ts Dried rosemary, crushed
      1 tb Chopped fresh thyme, or:
      1 ts Dried thyme, crushed
           Salt
           Cracked black pepper
 
  Use indirect heat, as explained in the recipe to cook a whole turkey or
  turkey breast. Allow 1 3/4 to 3 1/4 hours' cook- ing time, depending on the
  size of your turkey and heat of the coals.
  
  Prepare coals and grill.
  
  Remove neck and giblets from turkey. Rinse turkey under cold water; drain
  and pat dry with paper towels.
  
  Combine oil, herbs and seasonings in a small bowl. Generously brush on
  cavities and outer surface of turkey, reserv- ing some mixture to use as a
  baste.
  
  Pull turkey skin over the neck; secure with a skewer. Tuck wings under back
  and tie legs together with kitchen twine.
  
  Arrange medium-hot briquettes on two sides of a large metal or foil drip
  pan. Fill the pan halfway with hot tap water.
  
  Place turkey, breast side up, on grill, directly above the drip pan. Cover
  grill and cook turkey 11 to 15 minutes per pound, or until an instant-read
  meat thermometer registers 180 degrees F, basting occasionally with
  reserved herb mixture.
  
  Add a few briquettes to both sides of the fire every hour or as necessary
  to maintain a constant temperature.
  
  Garnish with additional fresh herbs, if desired.

           -- (carrots, turnips,
           -- string beans or
           -- zucchini)
 
  For the Chicken: ================
  
       To bone the chicken, producing two servings (or globi) per chicken,
  begin by cutting down along the breast bone, scraping along the bone to
  keep the meat intact.  Disjoint the wing and continue boning along the
  wishbone.
  
       Turn the chicken over and cut along the back bone, carving out the
  meat from the bone.  Disjoint the thigh and continue to remove the entire
  half of the chicken with the skin intact.
  
       Cut off the wing at the first joint leaving only the shoulder bone
  attached to the carcass.  Scrape the meat off of this remaining wing bone
  to remove the bone, leaving meat and skin attached to the half chicken.
  
       Remove the thigh bone, leaving meat attached to the chicken half. Cut
  around the knob end of the leg, releasing the skin and the tendons. Press
  the leg meat and skin firmly toward the thigh so that 1 1/2 to 2 inches of
  the leg bone is exposed.  Cut the knob off the end of the leg bone.
  
       Repeat the process with the second half of the chicken.
  
       Marinate the chicken meat for one hour in cognac, thyme and bay leaf.

      Title: CORNBREAD MASON-DIXON STUFFING
 Categories: Grains, Stuffing, Poultry
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      4 c  Dry cornbread crumbs
           (from your favorite NON-
           SWEET cornbread recipe)
      4 c  Dry white bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      2    Onions, chopped
      6    Ribs celery (including
           -some tops), chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans or walnuts
      1 cn Corn, undrained, OPTIONAL
           Chicken broth/turkey stock
           -to moisten
           Sage, thyme, salt and
           -pepper to taste
 
  As a Californian, married into a Southern family, I can warn you that the
  traditional cornbread stuffing probably isn't gonna be to his taste. The
  first time I had the stuff, I found it gritty, nasty, and just plain wierd.
  
  Wes, on the other hand, was less than enthralled by the sage-laden stuff
  that *I* think ought to go into a bird.  Now, we compromise, with a
  dressing that we both enjoy.
  
  Crumble the cornbread and white bread into a big bowl.
  
  Melt the butter in a large frying pan, add the onions and celery, and cook
  over low heat until the vegetables are soft, but not browned. Dump the
  butter/vegetable mixture over the bread.  Stir in the nuts, canned corn and
  its liquid (if used), seasonings.  Add broth to moisten to the consistancy
  you like (Western-style dressing tends to be a bit dryer than the Southern
  version).

      Title: HOLIDAY TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Turkey
           Margarine; room temperature
           Salt, kosher
           Pepper
      2 lg Onion; quartered
      1    Celery stalk; w/leaves
      2 c  ;Water
           Flour
           ;Water
 
  Cut the celery in large pieces.  Mix some flour and water together and make
  a thick, creamy "kid's paste," then water it down a bit. Thaw any size
  turkey.  Wash it down real good in the sink and don't be ashamed of
  scrubbing her down good.  Make the old girl sing like Ethel Merman.  My
  kids lived for this event each year as all my turkeys sang in the shower as
  if their forthcoming debut was at Town Hall. This bird you're washing is
  the star of the show and should be treated as such. You'll have more fun
  watching the turkey bathe if you select a noted singer.  I've cooked
  several Ethel Merman turkeys and a Kate Smith or two and I remember one
  Billie Holiday bird.
  
  Slightly dry Ethel with paper towels.  Grab a handful of margarine and rub
  it between your hands.  Now rub the star as if she's getting her final
  massage.  Make sure you get plenty of margarine rubbed into the bird. Now,
  with margarine still on your hands, rub a palmful of salt between your
  hands and apply this to the bird as you did the margarine, making sure
  plenty of salt gets rubbed in.  You need not worry about too much salt or
  margarine and a couple of handfuls may be required.
  
  Lightly pepper the bird, but don't rub this in.  Dip your hands in the
  creamy paste created from the watered down "kid's paste" of flour and
  water.  Dab this lightly on the skin all over, careful not to go over areas
  already covered with paste.   This is not a crust, but a more delicious
  sealer.
  
  Place turkey in a large roasting pan.  Place quartered onions under wings
  behind drumsticks, in the cavity, and some on the bottom of the pan to cook
  in the broth that you'll need later on.  Now place the celery along- side
  the onion and leave the celery tops in the bottom of the pan to cook in the
  broth.
  
  Pour two cups of cool water in the bottom of the pan.  DO NOT pour over the
  turkey.  Preheat oven to 350 F. and let the bird cook slow. Cover and cook
  the turkey for at least a couple of hours or until the meat turns brown and
  falls apart at the limbs.  This is a tender turkey and will not hold up to
  carving at the table.  Prepare your turkey platter on the kitchen cabinet
  as this bird will fall apart if you try and lift it. After the turkey has
  cooked for at least 1-1/2 hours, baste the turkey every 30 minutes. Drain
  off broth and reserve to make the stuffing.

      Title: MANCHA MANTELES
 Categories: Mexican, Loo
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Small turkey, in serving
           Pieces, or 2 chickens
    1/2 c  Lard
      2    Ancho chiles, chopped
      2    Pasilla chiles, chopped
      2    Serrano chiles, chopped
      4 oz Almonds,blanched,slivered
      1 tb White sesame seeds
      2    Chorizos, peeled/chopped
      1 lg Onion, sliced thin
    1/2 lb Tomatoes, peeled, seeded,
           And chopped
      1 ts Cinnamon powder
      2 c  Turkey or chicken stock
      1 tb Sugar
      5 ts Cider vinegar
      1 ts Salt or to taste
      4 oz Pineapple, chunked
      2    Firm cooking apples,
           Peeled, cored, & sliced
      1 lg Unripe banana, peeled
           And sliced
 
  This looks very much like Mancha manteles, which Richard [Manchurian
  Candidate] Condon describes in The Mexican Stove:
  
    Two little women staggered in from another room carrying a gigantic
    bowl of something which was jetting hot perfume. The sen~ora hoped
    I enjoyed mancha manteles. Reyes explained that this was the second
    Mexican meal of my life, ... but that he knew that I would -love-
    mancha manteles. The sen~ora beamed and instructed me to eat heart-
    ily, remembering that the translation of mancha manteles was: ta-
    blecloth stainer. I was sweating hard as she overdid me the honor
    of preparing my plate, a very wide plate, perhaps a foot in diam-
    eter. The tablecloth stainer contains the following: one turkey,
    four chorizo sausages, sliced pineapples, sliced apples, sliced
    bananas, some pork; ancho, pasilla and serrano chiles; almonds,
    cinnamon, lard, and tomato puree. Reyes scooped away as though
    he had picked up a fake stomach at Macy's. I got through it. ...
    A very peculiar physiological metamorphosis happened to Reyes
    that afternoon. When he entered the chairman's house he was a
    well-set-up, definitely not stout fellow who spoke American with
    a marked California accent. After that dinner he was not only a
    stout man - and I mean a shorter, rounder, fatter man with a
    pronounced paunch - but his speech changed. He would ramble in
    the diction of a jazz musician or break into voluble Spanish.
    Not that the sen~ora's meal taught him to speak Spanish. He had
    always spoken Spanish. But never to Jewish delicatessen waiters,
    for example, or to austere British bootmakers.
  
  Brown turkey in lard. Remove. Pour off fat, leaving 2 T in the pan. Fry
  chiles, almonds, and sesame seeds together until fragrant. Blend to a puree
  in a blender. Fry chorizo meat in the fat that remains in the pan. Remove.
  In the same fat, cook onions until soft. Add blended mixture, tomatoes, and
  cinnamon. Cook a few minutes and then turn out the whole mess into a large
  casserole. Mix in the stock, sugar, vinegar, and salt. Taste for seasoning.
  Add browned turkey pieces, chorizo meat, and fruit. Cover and simmer 45 min
  to 1 hr. After Richard Condon's recipe and description.

      Title: MOIST HOLIDAY TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     18 lb Tom Or Hen Turkey *
    1/4 lb Butter
      3 tb Fresh Orange Juice
           Stuffing of Choice **
           Salt
 
  * Fresh or frozen. ** Do not add any salt to your stuffing mix.
  ~---- ~--
  Preheat oven to 325F.  Remove the giblets from the bird.  Rub the inside
  of the clean body cavity with salt until there is a coating of salt over
  the whole inside.  This holds the juice inside the bird and the salt will
  season your dressing. Even after cooking most of the salt will remain
  inside of the body cavity. Place the stuffing in the bird and close the
  body cavity.  Melt the butter and add the orange juice. Baste the bird with
  the butter/orange juice mixture. Place a meat thermometer between the thigh
  and body in the meaty part of the thigh, not touching any bone. Bake the
  bird until the thermometer reads 190F, basting frequently. When the skin
  turns golden brown, tent the bird with a large sheet of aluminum foil.
  Allow the bird to cool while making gravy, then carve and serve a moist
  holiday tradition.  If you use an aluminum baking pan it will add about one
  hour to the baking time.  If a moist turkey is what you want, give this
  method a try.  I have not had any problems with using the excess salt and I
  have a problem with too much salt.  From: Syd's Cookbook.

  Full Title : Roulade of Turkey with Foie Gras and Sauterne Sauce with
  Crispy Sweet Potatoes
  
  From Peter Kelly of Piermont, N.Y.
  
  Turkey roulade: Remove skin from turkey breast with sharp knife. Slice in 4
  slices. Between sheets of plastic wrap, lightly pound turkey cutlets into
  paillardes (thin sheets). Season with Kosher salt and pepper.
  
  Divide foie gras (or chopped liver) in 4 parts and season with salt and
  pepper. Place a piece of foie gras in center of each turkey paillarde and
  roll turkey around foie gras.
  
  Carefully remove cabbage leaves, one at a time, first removing core. Boil
  cabbage leaves in a large pot just until wilted, about 3 minutes, and
  refresh under cold running water. Dry thoroughly.
  
  For each roulade, lay out 2 or 3 cabbage leaves to form a square. Place
  turkey roulade in center and wrap with cabbage, forming a tight bundle.
  Refrigerate. Sautene sauce: Over high heat, reduce 1 cup of sauterne and 1
  cup of chicken broth until sauce coats back of spoon (about 12 minutes).
  Sprinkle in 1/3 cup sun-dried cherries.
  
  Crispy sweet potatoes: Peel potato and poach in boiling water until just
  tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and slice very thin and then cut into julienne
  strips. In large saute pan, heat vegetable oil to hot, and fry potato
  strips for 1 minute, or until crisp. Pat dry with paper towels and toss
  with salt and pepper. To serve: Place roulades in center of bamboo steamer
  and steam exactly 15 minutes. Turkey will be cooked through and foie gras
  will be pink in center. Reheat sauterne sauce and spoon, with cherries, on
  4 warmed plates. Place roulade in center of each plate and arrange crispy
  sweet potatoes around.

      Title: TURKEY & CHILE SOUP
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 oz Can of tomatoes
      7 oz Can of diced green chiles
      1    Onion, cut into chunks
      3 c  Chicken broth or
           -homemade turkey stock
      3 c  Bite-size pieces of
           -cooked turkey
      2 c  Cooked brown rice
     10 oz Pk frozen whole kernel corn
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Chili powder
 
  This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers.  I use the
  carcass to make the stock first.  I throw in any vegetables I want to use
  up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot
  greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too hard by accident.
  After straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables I use the
  following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways with Chicken" cookbook, which
  I usually double.  I also use more broth and less turkey than they call
  for, I really don't measure the ingredients, I just add what I've got until
  it's as thick as I want it and the proportions look right.
  
  In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid, chiles
  and onion; whirl until smooth.  Pour into a large pan, add broth and bring
  to a boil over high heat.  Add turkey, rice, corn, garlic and spices.
  Reduce heat and simmer until heated through.
  
  Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their recipe
  calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn tortilla chips
  sometimes.  -- Sandra Chaffin (fnsjc@aurora.alaska.edu)

      Title: TURKEY BREAST
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Turkey breast
           Pepper
           Canola oil
           Salt
           Cayene pepper
 
  * Keep the skin on. Even thought it has the fat, it will keep the meat
  moister. Slather the skin with the canola oil. It will help with the
  browning. Most of the oil will dissipate during cooking. Sprinkle the
  breast with salt, Black pepper, and Cayenne pepper. Place the Roast on the
  grill with a moderate charcoal fire and cover. It will take about 1 hour to
  cook a 2-3 lb breast. As always check it after the hour and adjust. For
  those who are not fat intimidated, use butter instead of oil and add a
  little hickory wood for smoke. The skin will have a distinctive bacon
  flavor.

      Title: TURKEY KABOBS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 swords
 
      2 lb Turkey breast, diced 1" cube
      2    Bell Peppers diced 1" cube
      1 md Onion, diced 1" cube
      1 lg Can pineapple chunks
     10 lg Mushrooms
 
  * Make sure the Kabob swords fit your grill. Either they should fit
  entirely inside the grill or long enough to place across the lip of the
  cooker like a rotisserie. This way the meat and vegetables will cook
  evenly. * Make a moderate fire.
  
  Dice all of the turkey breast, onion, and bell peppers. Alternate red and
  green peppers to make a nice presentation. Use the pineapple juice to
  marinate the mushrooms for about an hour. Thread the meat and vegetables on
  the swords as you think will make a good presentation. Cook over the fire
  until the meat is done. Baste with the pineapple juice while cooking. Serve
  with white rice.

      Title: TURKEY SCALLOPINE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    6 ounce Turkey Escalopes
      1    Glass Sparkling Muscatel
           -grape juice or vermouth
      5 fl Double Cream
           Salt and Pepper
      1 tb Oil
      1 tb Butter
 
  Wrap the escalopes in clingfilm and flatten gently with the back of a heavy
  frying pan until they are really thin. Peel off the clingfilm.
  
  Heat the oil then the butter in a large frying pan. Put in the meat and
  press down firmly so it is all in contact with the frying pan.
  
  Let it sizzle for between one minute and a minute and a half, depending on
  how thin you've managed to flatten the escalopes, turn them over and repeat
  the timing.
  
  The meat will be thoroughly cooked through - you do not ever want pink
  turkey - but very tender. Put the meat on warmed plates.
  
  Pour the grape juice or vermouth into the frying pan, stir it round to pick
  up all the bits from the meat, then add the double cream and let it bubble
  (double cream boils beautifully) and reduce slightly.
  
  Pour it over the turkey and serve with pasta or new potatoes and mangetout.

      Title: ULTIMATE SMOKED TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1    Turkey; 8 to 10 pounds
      1 md Onion
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  White wine
           Super smoking sauce; (see r
           -ecipe)
 
      Rinse turkey, pat dry and rub liberally with oil (we'd rub it with
  Liquid Smoke instead). Place onion, bay leaves and wine in water pan with
  hot water (we'd add a few sticks of celery and a few cloves of garlic).
  Place water pan in smoker and turkey on grid (it won't hurt to put a
  quartered onion, a few stalks of celery and a bay leaf inside the turkey;
  we also sometimes mix freshly ground black pepper, a bit of salt and some
  crushed thyme together and after loosening the breast skin with your hands,
  push this mix up under the skin and spread over the breast of the turkey).
  Place dome on smoker and do not remove until midway through cooking time.
  Then remove dome and liberally paint turkey with Super Smoking Sauce.
  Replace dome and continue smoking. When turkey is done, liberally paint
  again and allow to smoke for 15 minutes more. Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
  Charcoal:  Use 10 pounds charcoal, 5 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks (we
  use about 5 to 8 presoaked wood blocks) and smoke 4 to 6 hours. Electric:
  Use 4 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks and smoke 4 to 6 hours. Add water to
  water pan after about 4 hours or as needed (you can tell when smoker needs
  water by the sizzling sound it will make). Recipe from "Cook'n Cajun Water
  Smoker Cookbook" by Sondra Hester. Submitted By Z@FYBITS.COM (Z PEGASUS) On

      1 tb Oil
 
  Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole and fry the turkey pieces until
  golden brown.
  
  Add the onions, potatoes and pepper. Mix in the tomatoes, breaking them unp
  slightly with a fork. add the herbs and enough water just to cover the
  turkey.
  
  Simmer on top of the stove or in an oven preheated to gas mark 4/350F/180C
  for 45 minutes. Season generously then add sweetcorn.
  
  If the sauce is very thin, dissolve a teaspoon of cornflour in a little
  water and stir it into the casserole. Bring gently to the boil until the
  sauce thickens.
  
  You don't really need anything else with this, though you could follow it
  with a little spinach salad.

  When the venison, pork and hot water are well mixed, add spices and honey

  This is probably my favorite recipe eventhough this is the one which has
  evolved the most in the past 5 years.  A couple of years ago my father
  mistakenly calculated the spices in tablespoons instead of teaspoons, and
  it
  was better then the previous batch of sausage written above.  The next
  year we
  increased the amount of black pepper, and was it ever good.  So if you like
  spices, and in sausage a little spice is good, then play around with the
  mixture a little bit.  I will be adding a small amount of a "cajun" pepper
  mix
  to a small 20 lb. test batch of sausage this weekend.

           -with tail section
           -attached, deveined
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!
  Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

      3    Eggs

--ASSEMBLING AND FRYING--
    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang), each 6 1/2 inches
           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in
  batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or
  let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat
  for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove
  the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low
  oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as
  an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a
  main course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

      Title: FRIED WON TONS
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Won ton skins
    1/2 lb Fresh ground pork
    1/2 lb Fresh prawns
      4    Dried mushrooms, soaked for
           -2 hours
      8    Water chestnuts, finely
           -chopped
      2    Stalks green onions, finely
           -chopped
      2 sm Eggs, beaten
    1/4 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Here are three won ton related recipes++fried won tons, won ton soup
  and a dip for the fried won tons.  I have recipes for won ton dough
  too, if you want them.  Personally, I find the won ton skins
  available in markets to be just fine and a lot less work!
  
  Yield: About 60 to 70.
  
  Shell and devein prawns.  Mince fine.  Stem mushrooms and mince caps.
  Mix with prawns, pork, water chestnuts, green onions, half of the
  beaten eggs and all of the seasonings.
  
  WRAPPING:
  
  Place won ton squares on working surface so corners face up, down,
  left and right.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each skin.
  
  Dip a little of the beaten egg onto the bottom corner, bring top
  corner to meet bottom corner.  Press to seal.  Moisten left corner
  and bring right corner to meet it.  Press to seal.  [This should give
  you a little bundle that looks kinda like a nurses hat.  S.C.]
  
  FRYING:
  
  Heat 4 cups oil in wok.  Fry wrapped won ton until golden (about 2
  minutes).  Turn over once.  Drain and serve hot.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES:
  
  Deep fry won ton, cool and freeze.  To reheat, preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Place frozen won ton onto cookie sheets and heat for 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  COMMENTS:
  
  You may substitute ground turkey for meat in won ton filling.
  
  However since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add a few more
  water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to enhance flavor
  and texture.

      Title: NUOC LEO (PEANUT SAUCE)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Clove garlic, sliced
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Piece of pork liver (see
           -note below), minced
      1 tb Ground pork
      1 ts Tomato paste
    1/4 c  Tuong
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 ts Peanut butter
      1 tb Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 tb Sesame seeds
     10    Roasted peanuts, coarsely
           -chopped [I use unsalted
           -Planter's roasted
           Peanuts.]
           Thin strips of hot pepper
           -for garnish
 
  I prefer the following version.  It's a bit more complex, but one of
  the ingredients might be a bit hard to find++tuong, a kind of soy
  bean paste used in Vietnam.  A good Vietnamese market will have it.
  Using medium heat, fry the garlic in the oil.  Add the liver and
  pork. Lower the heat and add the tomato paste; stir and add the
  tuong. Stir again and add the water and peanut butter.  Raise the
  heat to medium and add the sugar. Boil for 1 minute and transfer to a
  bowl.
  
  Add the sesame seeds to a medium-hot frying pan, stirring constantly
  until browned.  This should take 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sesame
  seeds to the nuoc leo, along with the chopped peanuts.
  
  The sauce can be garnished with thin strips of hot pepper.
  
  NOTE:  Beef or chicken liver can be substituted, but pork liver is
  preferred.  The piece should be the size of a large chicken liver.

      Title: PORK, HERB AND SULTANA STUFFING
 Categories: Poultry, Stuffing, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 tb Butter or margarine
    500 g  Minced pork
      2 c  Sultanas
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
     10    Green (spring) onions,
           -chopped
      2    Onions, finely chopped
      1 c  Bread crumbs
           I cup parsley, chopped
      2 tb Fresh coriander, chopped
      2 tb Fresh oregano, chopped
        g  Rind of 1 orange.
 
  The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when
  you're faced with yet another turkey to fix.  One is from the US, the
  rest are from other parts of the world.  The Argentine Creole
  Stuffing looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to
  stuff and cook a turkey.
  
  Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds
  richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts
  this stuffing out of the ordinary.
  
  Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,
  pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients
  and mix well.

      Title: SICHUAN DRY-FRIED STRING BEANS
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Dried shrimp
      1 tb Preserved Sichuan Preserved
           -Vegetable (jar choy)
      3 c  Peanut oil for deep frying
      1 lb String beans, snapped in
           -half
      1 tb Minced ginger
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      4 oz Ground pork butt
      1    Green onion, minced
      1 ts Sugar
        pn White pepper
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Chicken stock
           A swirl of sesame oil
 
  This green-bean dish is outstanding.  The green beans exude aromatic
  flavors and have an interesting chewy texture.  I do not fry the
  beans as long as traditional recipes call for because I want them to
  have some texture left.
  
  Cover the dried shrimp with hot water for 30 minutes.  Drain.  Chop
  into the consistency of coarse bread crumbs.
  
  Rinse the Sichuan preserved vegetables with cold water to wash off the
  brine and salt; chop into the same texture as the shrimp. In a hot
  wok add the oil and heat to 375F.
  
  Deep fry the beans in two or three batches for 2 to 3 minutes or
  until they look wrinkled, blistered and khaki color.
  
  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the oil from the wok.  Reheat the wok
  over high heat.
  
  Add the ginger and garlic; stir-fry for 15 seconds.  Add the pork,
  preserved mustard, dried shrimp; stir-fry for 1 minute longer. Poke
  and break up the clumps of pork so that it looks crumbled.  Add the
  green onion, sugar, white pepper and soy sauce; toss together to
  blend.
  
  Return the reserved green beans, chicken stock and sesame oil; toss
  vigorously over high heat until all liquids are reduced and absorbed,
  about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
 

 

 
      Title: TAPIOCA SOUP
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      5 c  Pork stock [Chicken works
           -just fine. S.C.]
    1/2 c  Minced or ground pork
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      3 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 c  Tapioca
    1/2 c  Cooked or canned crab meat
           Pepper

----GARNISH----
      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
     12    Coriander leaves
 
  Tapioca is a plant product made from the roots of the cassava plant-
  ~also called manioc.  It's a major product in Thailand and I saw
  "tapioca trees" all over the place.  The plant itself isn't a tree,
  but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set
  upright in the fields so they don't rot during the rainy season.
  Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks
  like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be
  removed by cooking.  Those little balls are actually made++like
  risotto or "rice pasta".  It's usually used to make sweet puddings
  here, but in the Orient it's used to make thick, savory soups.  Like
  this one!
  
  Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot
  stock into a bowl and stir in the pork.  Return mixture to the pan.
  Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook
  for 5 to 10 minutes.  When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat
  and season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat.  Line
  individual soup bowls with the lettuce.  Pour in the soup and
  sprinkle with coriander leaves.
  
  From "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and Tettoni, Times
  Editions, Singapore.  1987.
  
  This is a simple, excellent soup and subject to all sorts of
  variations.

      Title: VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS (CHA GIO)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----FILLING----
      2 oz Cellophane noodles,
           -soaked in warm water for
           -20 minutes, then drained
           -and cut onto 1-inch lengths
      1 lb Ground pork
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Tree ears, soaked in warm
           -water for 30 minutes, then
           -drained and finely chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, finely
           -chopped
      3    Shallots or white part of 3
           -scallions, finely chopped
      1 cn (7 ounces) crabmeat,
           -cartilage removed and meat
           -flaked with fingers
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper

----PREPARATIONS FOR ASSEMBLING----
     20    Sheets dried rice papers
           -(banh trang)
      4    Eggs, well beaten
      2 c  Peanut oil

ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR SERVING
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           Carrot Salad
           Double recipe of Nuoc Cham
 
  Here they are!  The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.
  
  Yields 80 spring rolls.
  
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper
  on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over
  the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for
  the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes
  about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on
  several wrappers at a time.
  
  When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of
  filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the
  sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.
  
  After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
  put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,
  and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
  
  To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:
  
  Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint
  leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the
  directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc
  cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,
  2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each
  person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the
  nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using
  chopsticks or a fork.
  
  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.
  
  Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables
  on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a
  cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips
  it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.
  
  NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps
  them crisper than frying in any other oil.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      2 c  Warm water
    1/4 c  Sugar
           Sixteen 8-inch round dried
           -rice paper wrappers
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
           Lettuce leaves
           Fresh mint leaves
           Cilantro leaves

----FILLING----
      3 tb Small dried tree ear
           -mushrooms
      2 oz Bean thread noodles
      1 lb Ground pork butt
      4    Garlic cloves, finely minced
      4    Shallots, minced
      1 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 ts Pepper
      1 c  Grated carrot
      1 c  Bean sprouts, tailed

-DIPPING SAUCE-
      1    Garlic clove, squeezed
           -through a garlic press
    1/2 tb Sugar
      4 tb Fresh lime juice
      3 tb Fish sauce
      1    Fresh or dried red chile
           -seeded, finely minced
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Finely grated carrot
 
  Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial
  favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  I haven't tried this
  one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her
  stuff is usually bang-on.
  
  In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles
  in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree
  ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop
  and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch
  lengths; set aside.
  
  Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add
  tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your
  hands.
  
  Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish
  sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10
  minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated
  carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.
  
  To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow
  pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a
  second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a
  wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens
  to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.
  
  Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact
  log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log
  along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the
  log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper
  is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to
  enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the
  wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.
  
  Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover
  with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.
  
  To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat
  fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).
  Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to
  8 minutes.
  
  Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.
  
  Serving suggestions:
  
  Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces .  Dip into sauce and
  enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of
  coriander and mint.  Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part
  of a multi course meal.
  
  NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray
  with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate
  them overnight, wrapped in plastic.  Don't keep them longer than 1
  day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and
  frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet
  and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.
  
  Makes 16 rolls.

    1/2 c  Or so roasted peanuts,
           -coarsely ground
           Handful cilantro, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,
  the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form.  All
  these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.
  Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and
  texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,
  each of which balances these assertive flavors.
  
  Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and
  Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked
  through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped
  in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.

  NOTE: In the body of the accompanying article, the author suggests
  using pita bread lightly spread with hoisin and putting the patties
  into it along with some of the cabbage salad.  That's probably the
  way I'd go.

      Title: Jook, Chinese Thick Rice Soup
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Long Grain Rice
    1/2 c  Glutinous Rice
      5 qt Chicken Broth
      1 lb Ground Pork
      1 tb Dark Soy Sauce
      1 t  Salt
      2 ea Green Onion Stalks
     12 ea Water Chestnuts
 
  Rinse rice 2 or 3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water
  chestnuts. Mix with ground pork, soy sauce and salt.
  Bring stock and rice to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3 hours or
  until the rice breaks down completely and the soup becomes thick and
  creamy. Turn heat up and add ground pork mixture, shaping 1 tsp at a time
  into a small ball and dropping it into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes or
  until pork balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve in individual soup
  bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person to choose his or her
  favourite toppings. I like Nam-Yuey in mine!
  You can make this ahead of time and reheat.
  You can also use chicken slices, ground beef, beef slices, fish filets or
  ham slices. A roast chicken or turkey carcass is excellent for making the
  stock. Just cook the carcass, rice and water together. Take out the
  carcass when the soup is done. I add Duck Liver Sausage bits!
  Condiments which you can use:
  Sesame oil, White Pepper, Green Onions, Chinese Parsley (cilantro), tea
  melon (sweet cucumber), Szechwan turnips, chopped peanuts, Deep Fried
  Devils (Yao Ja Guai, which are small fried bread sticks), NAM-YUEY!

      Title: Blistered String Beans with Pork
 Categories: Vegetables, Chinese, Cathe
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      3 c  Oil
      2 lb String beans
    3/4 lb Ground pork
    1/2 T  Dried shrimp
      4 T  Dry sherry
      2 T  Szechuan mustard green
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Water
      1 T  Soy sauce
      1 T  Sesame oil
 
  Rinse the beans and break off the ends; dry them thoroughly to reduce
  spattering during deep-frying.  Rinse and mince the Szechuan mustard green.
  
  Wash the dried shrimp and soak them in sherry for 1 hour.  Drain them,
  reserving the sherry.  Mince the shrimp.
  
  Mix the sherry from the shrimp with the chicken broth, water, soy sauce and
  sesame oil.  Reserve.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok (or deep pan) until a bamboo chopstick sizzles when
  put into the oil.  Deep fry the beans in 5 or 6 batches, until they develop
  brown blisters and shrivel slightly. Remove them batch by batch; drain each
  batch and keep them warm while you remove all but 2 T oil from the pan.
  
  Heat the 2 T of oil until very hot and add the ground pork.  Stir fry until
  it is broken up into very small pieces and no longer is pink. Add the
  minced shrimp and Szechuan mustard green.  Stir for 30 seconds. Add the
  string beans and stir to mix well for about 15 seconds.
  
  Add the liquid ingredients, toss until the liquid is reduced to 2
  tablespoons.  Serve on a warmed platter.
 

 

 
      Title: ENCHILADAS SABROSAS
 Categories: Meats, Latin, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Ground meat (mixed
           -ground beef and
           -ground pork)
      1 md Onion
    1/2    Green pepper
      5    Garlic cloves
      1    Cilantro bunch
    1/2 t  Red pepper
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Cumin (or more)
    1/2 c  Wine or sherry
    3/4 c  Black olives
  1 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
           -(1 small can)
     12    Corn tortillas
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
    1/2 c  Sour cream (optional)
           Oil
 
  Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground meats.
  Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the chopped green
  pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for another minute or two
  (until green pepper is cooked bright green).  Drain well, then add (about)
  several tablespoons of the enchilada sauce and cook for a few minutes
  longer. Set aside.
  
  Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce (from
  the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry, cumin, salt,
  red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how compulsive you
  are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and spicy.
  
  Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the
  enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy (you'll
  be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.
  
  The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some of
  its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package, separate them
  from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the frying pan surface on
  each side, to moisten them slightly with the grease. That done, stack them
  in the frying pan and heat them until they are soft and pliable.
  
  The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed:  Take the
  tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven  dish, curved into a
  "U" shape, each right next to its neighbor.  (At this point, start heating
  your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan.  I usually wind up preparing 10
  tortillas in all.)
  
  Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed by an
  appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive halves.  Then
  curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the opposite end, and
  carefully rotate it to conceal the seam.  Each tortilla should be filled
  firmly (not too loosely) but not overflowing the ends.
  
  Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled
  tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the
  crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover with
  aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the tortillas are soft
  and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5 minutes, then serve, topped
  with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail to drain the meat well enough, the
  enchiladas will be greasy. If over-baked, it tastes all right, but the
  tortillas lose their texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite
  forgiving in its proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own
  tolerance for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours
  before baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for
  a day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and some
  Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Enchiladas with meat, black olives and cheese -- For many years, I've
  been involved in Latin American "solidarity work" here in the San Francisco
  area, and as a result, I have learned some of its culinary pleasures. This
  recipe originated from the back of a can of enchilada sauce in Mexico, but
  was refined by a special Chilean refugee friend who won a scholarship to
  the California Culinary Academy (in San Francisco) and now cooks
  ever-so-lusciously.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
