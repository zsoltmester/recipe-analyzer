      1 lg Yellow onion
           - cut into wedges 1/2" thick
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 ts Herbes de Provence
      3 pn Saffron threads
      1 lg Strip orange zest (2" long)
      2    Bay leaves
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Chopped parsley
     12    Nicoise olives, pitted; -OR-
           - Gaeta or oil-cured
           - Black olives, pitted
  PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if large,
  into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're scarred, and
  cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave some of the core so
  that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes into large, neat pieces.
  Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to taste and the potatoes, and
  boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes, but save the water. While the
  potatoes are cooking, warm the olive oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the
  leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay
  leaves. Cook slowly over medium heat until the onions have begun to soften,
  after 6 or 7 minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately
  half, then add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
  parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water to
  cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can set the
  stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top of the stove.
  If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook slowly until the
  vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking in the oven, preheat it
  to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1 hour, or until done. Remove bay
  leaves. Garnish with the remaining parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic
  mayonnaise.

  No, here, with the Tex-Mex influence, they're very big on tortilla soup,
  which is a chicken-based soup that has tortilla chips or sliced, fried
  tortilla strips on top.  If it's made well, it's wonderful.  However, I've
  had some that tastes like soap.  Here are some recipes that I haven't
  tried, so I can't vouch for them.  They are from pretty trust- worthy
  sources, though.  Let me know what you think.  If they don't do the trick,
  I'm sure I can hunt down some more.

  Chop onion and celery.  Mince garlic.  Saute onion, celery and garlic in
  oil until tender.  Add all the remaining ingredients except the tortillas,
  cheese, and cilantro (which is optional). Simmer 30 minutes.  Cut tortillas
  into strips and simmer 2 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with cheese.
  Other options are to top with avocado, cilantro, and a dollop of sour
  cream. From _Flavors of Simon David_, March 1991

  stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let
  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
  large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
  and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
  turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
  left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
  the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
  over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
  per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
  the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
  Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
  heat noodles and serve.

           Salt
           Freshly-ground black pepper
  PREPARATION:  Rinse, pick over beans, and put them in a bowl of cold water
  to cover by 3 inches.  Let stand for 24 hours; drain.  (OR, put beans in a
  large saucepan with water to cover, bring to a boil, cover, remove from
  heat, and let stand for 1 hour; drain.) Peel and mince the garlic. Peel and
  coarsely chop the tomato.  Cut the fennel into 1/4-inch dice. Rinse spinach
  and Swiss chard and cut into 1/2-inch julienne strips. Peel potatoes and
  carrots; leave whole.  Grate the cheese (1 1/2 cups).
  COOKING:  Put drained beans in a large saucepan; add ham hocks and 2 quarts
  water.  Bring to a boil, partially cover, and simmer for 20 minutes; drain.
  Bring 2 quarts of water to boil in a 6-quart soup kettle, add fennel,
  spinach and Swiss chard, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10
  minutes.  Drain and set aside.
  Heat oil in soup kettle.  Add garlic and saute until golden, about 1
  minute.  Add the tomato and cook over low heat until tomato liquid
  evaporates, about 10 minutes.  Add the beans, hocks, broth , and bay leaf.
  Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add whole potatoes and
  carrots, cover and simmer until they are tender, about 30 minutes longer.
  Transfer potatoes and carrots to a large plate and mash with a potato
  masher.  Return mashed mixture to the kettle, and stir in the spinach
  mixture, corn, and peas.  Bring soup to a boil, then simmer, stirring and
  skimming foam from surface occasionally, until peas and corn are tender,
  about 15 minutes.  Season with salt, if necessary.
  SERVING:  Ladle soup into warm bowls.  Sprinkle with ground pepper and
  cheese.
  Makes 10 to 12 main course servings.

           -quartered
      2 lg Carrots, peeled and
           -sliced thickly
      1 lg Onion, peeled and

           -quartered
      1    Bay leaf
     12    Peppercorns
     10 c  Water (2 1/2 qts)
  Yields 2 quarts.
  Vegetable Stock is a broth made by simmering vegetables in water until they
  are soft and their flavors and nutrients have been released into the
  liquid.  Then the stock is poured through a strainer and the vegetables are
  either discarded or used, pureed, to thicken a soup.
  The best vegetables to use in stock are carrots, peeled onions, celery,
  zucchini, potatoes and squash.  We often throw in chunks of apples or pears
  to sweeten the stock a little - especially if the carrots we're using
  aren't very sweet.  It's wise to avoid the strongly flavored vegetables of
  the cabbage family, such as broccoli and cauliflower, and turnips,
  rutabagas and kohlrabi - and vegetables with bleeding colors, such as
  beets, red cabbage and greens (unless you intend to make a borscht or cream
  of greens soup).  Green peppers and eggplant will make the stock bitter. Be
  cautious about adding lots of tomatoes or other acidic fruits or vegetables
  to the stock, because they may curdle the soup if you add milk or other
  dairy products later on.
  Wash all vegetables thoroughly, especially root vegetables.  Making stock
  is the perfect solution for vegetables that are too unattractive
  cosmeticallly to be used in other ways.  Leftover carrot sticks, parsley
  stems, and unused halves of onion can all be tossed into the pot.
  Put all of the ingredients into a large pot, bring to a boil, and simmer
  for 45 minutes to an hour.  Strain and use.
  For a spicier stock throw in some garlic cloves, skins and all, and a small
  amount of tomato.  For a specifically Asian broth, add ginger, scallions
  and shiitake mushrooms.  Or, make it sweet for a carrot puree or
  Scandinavian fruit soup with the addition of sweet potato or winter squash.

  A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways of
  preparing dry beans for cooking.  All start with a thorough inspection for
  damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in cold water.  The next
  step, which is highly recommended, is soaking the beans.  This not only
  helps make the beans cook faster, it also improves flavor, texture,
  appearance and digestibility.  For maximum improvement of these factors, it
  is recommended that the soak water be discarded and the beans rinsed and
  cooked in fresh water.
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so be sure
  to start with a large enough pot.  (Note:  up to 2 teaspoons of salt per
  pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.)
  Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover and
  set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak method), but *preferably* four
  hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater
  amount of the gas-causing properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping
  the beans to be more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects.
  Whether you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to
  DISCARD THE SOAK WATER.
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt.  Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness is
  reached.
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons onion salt
  and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Add 1 Tablespoon
  chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker helps,
  but follow manufacturer's directions.  [Personal note:  Tom says 1/2 hour
  in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to cooking them
  overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure cooker, as they
  expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or kidney
  beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings, lard, oil,
  butter or margarine.

  onions.  Cover and cook slowly until the onions are transparent. Blend in
  the flour. Stir slowly for 3 minutes, to cook the flour without letting it
  color.  Remove from heat and, when bubbling stops, pour in 1 cup of hot
  liquid all a once, whisking vigorously to blend smoothly. Whisk in 6 more
  cups. Bring to a simmer, stirring, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
  frequently.
      The soup base should coat a spoon lightly; add dollops of more liquid
  if too thick. Correct seasoning, and continue as your recipes directs.
  Makes about 2 quarts.
  Suggestion:  Use with Upperline's Ancho Crab Soup or Flagon's Cream of
  Mushroom and Brie Soup.

      3    Stalks celery, thinly sliced
      2 bn Parsley, chopped
           Sour cream to taste
  Best made in large quantities.  Recipe therefor serves 12.
  In a large pot, melt some of the lard and brown the meat in batches. Add
  more lard as required.  Remove the meat and reserve.  Fry onions until
  browned.  Remove onions from pot and reserve.  Add remaining lard. Add
  paprika and stir well.  Slowly add red wine and water, continuing to stir
  to make sure there are no lumps of paprika.  Add meat and onions to pot
  again.  Add potatoes, carrots, apples and spices.  Quantities are
  approximate, use more, or less, as you wish.  Cook gently, covered, for 3
  hours.  Check occasionally, and add more water as required.  Remove coarse
  spices, and add celery and parsley.  Serve with a bowl of sour cream, so
  each person can help themselves.
  NOTE:  This recipe does not mention salt, or pepper, which in my opinion
  ought to be included.

      Title: Venison Savory Stew
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  8
      2 lb Venison Roast (Boneless)
    1/2 c  White Wine
    1/8 c  Worcestershire Sauce
      1 c  Lentils
      1 lg Cucumber, Diced
      1    Jalepeno Pepper, Diced
      6 md Bannana Peppers, Chopped
      4 sm Potatoes, Quartered
      1    Box Of Fiber One
      1 pk Top Ramen Beef Fl. Noodles
      4    Triscuit Snack Crackers
    1/4 pk Ranch Dip Mix (Sour Cream)
  Do not skin, peel, or otherwise denude the vegetables or potatoes.  Wash
  them briskly and then cut them up.  The good stuff is in the skin, always,
  as the skin is what was intended to serve, protect and defend the pulp and
  seeds. Fill large crock pot half full of clean cold water. Add ingredients.
  Let cook on low heat for 12-16 hours. Season as desired during last 1 hour
  of cooking, adding bay, etc., as suits your individual collection of buds.
  This recipe may be done with any game animal, except that squirrel tends to
  be far too stringy for my taste.  If you like hearty and thick, this stew
  is for you.  It would also go well with beef, obviously. I do recommend a
  bay leaf added to the top for the last hour.

  A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways of
  preparing dry beans for cooking.  All start with a thorough inspection for
  damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in cold water.  The next
  step, which is highly recommended, is soaking the beans.  This not only
  helps make the beans cook faster, it also improves flavor, texture,
  appearance and digestibility.  For maximum improvement of these factors, it
  is recommended that the soak water be discarded and the beans rinsed and
  cooked in fresh water.
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so be sure
  to start with a large enough pot.  (Note:  up to 2 teaspoons of salt per
  pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.)
  Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover and
  set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak method), but *preferably* four
  hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater
  amount of the gas-causing properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping
  the beans to be more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects.
  Whether you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to
  DISCARD THE SOAK WATER.
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt.  Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness is
  reached.
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons onion salt
  and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Add 1 Tablespoon
  chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker helps,
  but follow manufacturer's directions.  [Personal note:  Tom says 1/2 hour
  in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to cooking them
  overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure cooker, as they
  expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or kidney
  beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings, lard, oil,
  butter or margarine.

      Title: White and Green Bean Soup
 Categories: Soups, Beans
   Servings:  6
  1 1/2 c  Dried white beans, Great
           -Northern, navy, or baby
           -lima
      6 c  Water
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      2 ts Salt
      4 c  Beef broth
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Rosemary, crumbled
      2 c  Fresh green beans (about 3/4
           -lb), cut on the
           Diagonal in 1-inch pieces
      1 tb Butter
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
  Wash and pick over the dried beans.  Put them into a large saucepan or
  kettle with the water and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat, cover,
  and allow to stand for 1 hour.
  Return to the heat and bring to a boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer,
  partially covered, for 1/2 hour.  Using a heavy fork, mash the garlic with
  the salt until no large chunks remain.  Add to the saucepan with the beans.
  Add the broth, pepper, and rosemary.
  Simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender.  This can take 15
  minutes or as long as 1 hour; timing for beans is hard to predict - keep
  checking.
  Soup can be made ahead to this point, and refrigerated or frozen after
  thorough cooling.
  Cook the green beans uncovered in 2 uarts of boiling salted water until
  they are tender-crisp and bright green.  Drain and add to the soup when the
  white beans are tender but not mushy. If green beans are not to be added
  right away, rinse in cold water to retain color.  Stir in the butter and
  lemon.  Serve at once, while green beans are still bright.
  Note:  If you want some of the soup pureed, do it before adding the green
  beans - the color will be better.
  Serves 6 to 8.

  slices 1/4-inch thick. Roughly chop the chard leaves. Add the chard to the
  bean mixture and replace in the oven. If the soup is looking too thick, add
  some water. Cook another 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the oven and add

      Title: White Bean Soup
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  8
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Diced onion
      1    Carrot, peeled and sliced
      1    Stalk celery, sliced
      2 tb Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Diced country ham or
           -prosciutto
    3/4 lb Dried cannelloni or navy
           -beans, rinsed,
           Picked over, and soaked
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary (or 2
           -teaspoons dried)
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary (or 2
           -teaspoons dried)
      8 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
           Salt, to taste
  Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion, carrot,
  celery, garlic, and ham; saute, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.  Add
  the beans, rosemary, chicken stock, and pepper; bring to a boil.  Cover and
  simmer for 30 minutes.  Taste the cooking liquid, and add enough salt so
  that it becomes slightly salty (the amount needed will vary depending on
  the type of ham used for seasoning).
  Recover the pot and simmer for an additional 40 to 60 minutes, or until the
  beans are soft.
  Puree the mixture in a food processor fitted with the steel blade, or in a
  blender.  Serve hot.
  NOTE:  The soup can be made up to three days in advance and refrigerated,
  tightly covered.  It will probably thicken from the starch in the beans,
  and can be thinned to the desired consistency with some stock when it is
  reheated.
  Makes 8 servings.

   Servings: 12
     24    Quahogs (3 cups chopped meat
           -and liquor)
      3 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  (Approx) fish stock, clam
           -broth or water
      6    Leeks, trimmed and washed
      2    Onions
      4    Stalks celery
      3 oz Salt pork
      6    Strips bacon
    1/3 c  Flour
      3 lg Potatoes, peeled and diced
           Bouquet garni of bay leaf,
           -thyme and parsley
           Salt, pepper and cayenne
           -pepper
      2 c  Peanut oil for frying the
           -leeks
      1 c  Heavy cream
      4 tb Finely chopped chives or
           -parsley
      3 tb Butter
  This chowder has two twists: bacon is added in addition to salt pork and
  fried julienned leeks are used as a garnish.  The recipe comes from Ris
  Lacoste, chef at 21 Federal St. in Washington.
  Scrub the quahogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the wine.
  Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open. Shuck the
  quahogs and grind with a meat grinder or food processor. Strain the cooking
  liquid through damp cheesecloth - you should have 2 quarts. If you don'y,
  add fish stock, clam broth or water to make up the difference. Reserve the
  ground clams and the liquid separately.
  Finely chop three of the leeks.  Cut the remaining three leeks into fine
  julienne and reserve them for the garnish.  Finely chop the onion and
  celery.  Finely dice the salt pork and bacon.  Fry the salt pork and bacon
  in a large pot over medium heat to render the fat.  Remove the cracklings
  with a slotted spoon.  Discard all but 6 tablespoons of the fat.
  Add the chopped leeks, onion and celery to the pot and gently cook for 3 to
  4 minutes, or until soft.  Stir in the flour and cook over low heat for 3
  to 4 minutes.  Whisk in the reserved liquid and bouquet garni and gradually
  bring to a boil.  Add the potatoes and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
  tender.  Stir in the cream, ground quahogs, cracklings, and salt,pepper and
  cayenne to taste.
  Just before serving, heat the oil to 375F.  Fry the julienned leeks for 1
  minute until crisp.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. To
  serve, ladle the chowder into bowls.  Place a pat of butter in each bowl
  and garnish with the fried leeks.
  Makes 12 servings.
