Just before serving, mix a little of the soup with the   sour cream until the cream becomes rather liquid. If the soup seems too   thin, add a little flour to the sour cream mixture.

Barely cover with salted   water and cook until the fish comes off the bones. Don't cook until the   flesh is soft and mushy. Set aside to cool.      While fish is cooling, cut the pork into 1/4" cubes and fry until crisp in   a large heavy kettle. Drain the cubes on paper towels and pour off all but   4 tbls of the fat. In this fat, cook the chopped onions over low heat until   trnasparent.  Add the potatoes and enough of the fish liquor to cover them.   Simmer gently until potatoes are cooked.      Pick the fish flakes from the bones, adding to the chowder mixture when the   potatoes are done.  Add quart of milk and evaporated milk. Set aside until   serving time.      It imporves the flavor of the chowder greatly to let it stand for several   hours before serving.  Be sure it is piping hot when bringing it to the   table.      Biscuits and pickles always go with a good chowder.

"When I was younger, my   brothers used to make fun of me," says Storm. "Once, I was following this   wonderful chocolate-coffee bundt cake recipe, and I used a cup of   freeze-dried coffee grounds. The joke circulated around the family for   years, 'I ate a piece of Hannah's cake and was up for two days straight'."~   Storm has since honed her culinary skills. One dish she's mastered is her   mother's famous pumpkin soup. "This soup was always a mystery soup for   anyone outside of the family," says Storm. "My mother never liked to tell   people what was in it because they probably wouldn't try it."~ ~ * - not   pie filling~ ~ In a large soup pot, saute onion and mushrooms in butter for   1-2 minutes.

You can double or triple   the recipe and freeze it in useful quantities. Malla Karhusaari also   suggests reducing the cooking time by using a pressure cooker or microwave   to prepare it. Rinse peas and soak in cold water in large port for 8 hours   or overnight. Bring peas and soaking water to the boil, reduce to a simmer   and cook for one hour or until peas begin to soften. Add pork and continue   to simmer for two to three hours, until peas and meat ar thoroughly cooked.   When meat is tender, remove it from pot, discard skin and bone, cut meat in   cubes and return to soup. You may need to add more water to pot for desired   consistency. Season with marjoram, mustard, salt and pepper. Heat to blend   flavors and serve hot. Serves 6. From The Gazette, 91/01/30.

Split the leek in half lengthwise, and   cut it into 1/2-inch pieces.  Clean the leek by immersing the pieces in a   bowl filled with cold water.  Lift the pieces from the water and place them   in a sieve to drain.  Heat the oil in a pot. When hot, add the leek and   sliced onion, and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until they   soften and begin to brown lightly.  Add the stock, potatoes, salt and   pepper, and bring to the boil.  Boil for 30 to 40 minutes, until the   potatoes are tender.  Strain off most of the cooking juices and reserve   them. Add the solids with a little of the juices to the bowl of a food   processor, and process briefly, just until pureed.  (If too much liquid is   added to the processor bowl, the mixture will become too foamy.) Stir the   puree into the reserved juices.  You should have about 7 cups. The hot soup   can be served immediately, either plain or with croutons. FOR COLD SOUP:   Cool the soup and stir in the milk, chives and Tabasco sauce. Serve cold.   Serves 6. *If you cannot find leeks, add additional onions or scallions;   the soup will be very good, although it won't have the unique taste that   leeks give to soup.  If using leeks or scallions, be sure to make use of   the green as well as the white part of the vegetables, after trimming them   first, of course, to eliminate any damaged or wilted sections. The green   leaves lend color as well as taste and texture to the soup.

Cut leaves into pieces about 2-inch square, wash well and set aside.   Scrub and peel potatoes and add peels to heating water along with 1/2   teaspoon salt and 1 bay leaf. When water boils, lower heat and let it   simmer while you assemble remaining ingredients. Cut peeled potatoes into   pieces about 1/2-inch square. Heat oil in soup pot, add onion, garlic, red   pepper flakes and remaining bay leaf. Cook over medium-high heat 3 or 4   minutes, stirring frequently, then season with salt. Stir in potatoes and 1   cup strained simmering stock. Cover and cook slowly 5 minutes. Add kale,   cover again and steam until leaves are wilted, stirring once or twice.   Strain remaining stock into soup pot. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer   slowly, covered, until potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Use back of   wooden spoon to break up potatoes by pressing them against sides of pot or   puree 1 or 2 cups soup in blender and return it to pot to make unifying   background for other elements. Taste soup and season to taste with salt and   generous grinding of pepper. If possible, set soup aside 1 hour to allow   flavors to merge and develop even further, then serve with light sprinkling   of parsley.      DEBORAH MADISON - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS COOKBOOK

5    Minutes for zucchini or tiny            -broccoli orcauliflower            -flowerets.     Any leftovers in cans should be transfered to plastic containers - atwist   of foil or plastic in the case of anchovies, tomato paste, or pimientos -   and frozen. Vegetable cooking water (freeze) Leftover vegetables (can be   frozen, but better if not) Noodles, rice, pasta, kasha, beans (freeze)   Cream sauce, spaghetti sauce, gravy (freeze)      Before freezing leftover vegetable water, stock, broth, or tomato product,   cook some finely chopped onion, celery, and carrot in 1 - 2 Tbsp of butter   until they soften, then add the liquid and salt and pepper. Freeze the   mixture and you will have soup starter.  Use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of each   vegetable for 6 cups of soup.      Variations on the soup starter:      Before adding the vegetables, cook 2 slices of diced bacon in the butter.      Add 1 Tbsp paprika, chili powder, or curry powder to the vegetables as they   cook, before adding liquid:  1 Tbsp of flour can be added at this time,   too, to give the starter a little body.      Sherry or dry red or white wine, about 1/3 cup, can be added before the   other liquid and allowed to cook down to half.  This gives a richness to   the soup that will ensue.      Add 2 Tbsp of finely chopped parsley to the vegetables.      Add 1/3 cup of finely chopped green pepper.      Once you have the starter, the rest of the liquid can be added.  It can be   more of the same, or perhaps milk.  Heavy cream, yogurt, or sour cream are   added at the end, to heat but not boil, to avoid curdling.      The solids you put in can be infinitely varied:      Small pieces of stewing meat or soaked dried beans need about an hour to   cook.      Fresh vegetables take from about 20 minutes for root vegetables to about      Cooked vegetables should be put in just to warm, not to cook any further.   If they are already overcooked, perhaps it would be better to add a little   liquid and puree them.      Soup can be thickened by pureeing some or all of it, or for each cup of   soup add 1 tsp of rice or 3 Tbsp of grated raw potato or 1 Tbsp of flour   mixed with 2 Tbsp milk, water, or broth.      Finely chopped cabbage can cook for hours in a soup, spinach goes in at the   very end, for about a minute, remaining bright green.      Cooked ham, in chunks or julienne, sliced frankfurters, and sliced garlic   sausage have more flavor and give up some of their fat if they are lightly   sauteed before being added to the soup.

Remove   from heat and slowly stir in the flour.  Return to the heat, and cook,   stirring, for about 4 minutes.  Meanwhile, begin heating the stock in a   large pot.  Whisk the stock into the flour mixture.  Bring the stock to a   boil, whisking constantly, then reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.      Add the fish and simmer about 10 minutes longer.  Stir in the cream and   cheese, and simmer until the cheese melts, about 5 to 8 minutes. (You won't   distinguish the cheese as such, it is incorporated in the chowder.) Reheat   the chowder slowly so the cream doesn't boil.      Makes about 3 quarts.      Posted by Al Martin. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

Finally,   stir in a cup of tomato paste and let it all heat through.         MY NOTES:  I never used the Baco-bits or the white wine with this soup. The   lentils do not need to soak.  If you forget and soak them anyway, just cut   the simmering time a little.  Be sure to check the water level. This   becomes a very nice rich, thick stew-like soup, and can burn quickly. The   tomato paste adds a nice tang which benefits the lentils a lot. If I   remember right (it has been six months or so since I've made this), I am   not sure I used all the tomato paste they call for...  I think I may have   just opened a 6-oz. can and put that in (8 oz. is a cup, so I would be just   shy a little).  Don't think it makes a lot of difference... just add the   tomato paste to taste.  ;-) This is a very pretty soup (lentils being   pretty much just brownish, the carrots and onions and celery bits all some   nice color to it, and the tomato paste makes it have a kind of reddish   glow), and is nice served with a hearty slice of whole grain bread ...   especially on a cold winter night!

1    Text Only     From an article by Louise Tennent Smith.      "Making soup is fun, an exercise in kitchen creativity which cannot go   wrong---you can ALWAYS fix a soup.      "Homemade stock is good, and easy to make, though time consuming. But don't   give up on soup making if you haven't time to make your own. There are good   canned. dried and frozen bases that will allow you to whip up a good soup   in no time at all.      "Seasoning:  The stock itself gives the base seasoning to a soup, as do   herbs and spices added during the cooking.  The addition of wine frequently   enhances the flavor.  Add about one-quarter cup to one quart of soup just   before serving, and do not boil after adding.  Use sherry for light soups   with a chicken base, red wine with beef based soups, white wine with fish   soups.  A cup of beer for every three cups of soup is good with bean and   other hearty vegetable soups.      "Thickening:  Cooked cereals such as rice, noodles and dumplings give body   to a clear soup; added raw, they will thicken a soup.  Other thickeners   include egg yolks, pureed vegetables and roux of flour and butter.      "Color:  Soups using a good quantity of meat, onion skims, tomato skins or   browned onions usually have excellent color.  Other color additives include   browning sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, wine, tomato sauce and soy   sauce.  The latter group should be used with great care in delicate soups,   as their flavor might be overwhelming."      [THE BALTIMORE SUN; February 13, 1991]      Posted by Fred Peters.  
1    Stewing chicken, cut into            -pieces       2    Whole carrots, finely diced     1/2 c  Chopped parsley (preferably            -Italian parsley)       3 c  To 4 c cooked pastina or            -rice     FROM:      Shelley Rodgers (Jolly Rodgers:the Portuguese Pirate!   (1:161/202))      This recipe came from an unknown magazine.  Judging from the comments that   accompanied the recipe, apparently the magazine was running a Chicken   Recipe contest.      Mama Bina's Italian Chicken Soup No Chicken Recipe Contest worth its   bouillon would be complete without a recipe for chicken soup. This recipe   was submitted by Renata Pagliaro and Maureen Vieck of Cuperino, CA. Renata   writes: "I can remember as a child my mother would prepare chicken soup at   least once a week for dinner.  Typical of children, I thought that soup was   boring (hardly to be compared to a hot dog!) and I also thought it was some   strange dish that only Italians ate.      "Now that I am older and ore sophisticated (enough to even like spinach!),   I have come to appreciate my mother's chicken soup. It is delicate and so   simple taht it is actually elegant.  To top all of that, it is easy to   make, nutritious and low in calories."      salt to taste      Wash the chicken pieces and remove as much skin as possible.  Put the   chicken into a large dutch oven, fill with water and cook over high heat.   When the water boils, skim off the foam that comes to the surface and   discard.      When no more foam appears, put the carrots and parsley into the pot with   the chicken. Lower the heat to a simmer so taht the water doesn't boil   down. Do not cover. Add salt to taste and check every so often for flavor.      Allow to cook for 1-1/2 hours.  You may prepare rice or pastina in the   meantime and set it aside.  After soup has cooked, remove the chicken from   the pot with a slotted spoon.  Take the chicken off the bones and tear into   bite-sized pieces and place back into the broth.      Put the cooked and strained pastina or rice into the soup and allow to heat   through.  Just before serving, you may add a little butter for flavor.      Serve hot with a crusty French bread and a bottle of white wine.  This soup

Place vegetables, bacon and margarine in a 5 quart sauce pot. Saute over   medium heat until vegetables are tender.  Be careful not to brown or   scorch.      When vegetables are tender, add flour to make a roux.  Cook for two   minutes, allowing flour to cook while stirring occasionally.      Add clam juice and dairy products.  Stir by using a wire whip.      Add fresh garlic, black pepper, chopped clams and clam base. Cook over   low-medium heat stirring occasionally to prevent chowder from scorching.   Cook for two hours or until chowder is brought to desired thickness.      If a crockpot, or small steam kettle is available, it is recommended. Also,   clam juice can be added to thin chowder down if it gets too thick.      Note:  This soup is the BEST clam chowder I have ever tasted! It is thick   and very rich and fattening! I didn't use the clam base since I don't even   know what that is. Also, I didn't need to simmer it as long as suggested. I   cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. The chowder needs to be stirred OFTEN,   probably about every 5-10 minutes or so or it will stick to the bottom of   the pot.  Also, I one-and-one-halved times'd it, using about 3 lbs. of   chopped clams instead of the recommended amount.  I also served it with the   little soup "clam" crackers. It made about 5 quarts this way. Deb C.      [ Fisherman's Grotto Restaurant in Monterey, CA. ]      Posted by:  Shelley Rodgers - Cooking Echo Reprinted by: Debbie Carlson -   Cooking Echo

Grind ham and chicken, a little at a time, with just enough tomato juice   to keep mixture from clogging blender, or put meats through medium blade of   meat grinder without tomato juice. Set aside.   2. Fry bacon in a large, heavy skillet over low heat until crisp. Remove   bacon, drain, and crumble. Set aside.   3. In bacon fat in skillet, cook onion until soft. Add tomatoes and ground   ham and chicken. Cook until tomatoes are very soft. Stir in seasonings and   crumbled bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.   Serves 8-10 with barbecued meat; 6 as shortcake.   NOTE: Mrs. Neal Leuty, one of Plains' best cooks, serves this unusual and   unusually good stew in two ways; as an accompaniment to barbecued fresh   pork or chicken along with potato salad, or served with corn bread squares,   split and toasted, as a main course shortcake. Believe me - and you will   when you try it - this is positively scrumptious served either way.

Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover;   simmmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.         CHICKEN STOCK: Bony chicken pieces (backs, necks & wings) from 2 chickens 3   stalks celery with leaves, cut up 1 carrot, cut up 1 large onion, quartered   1 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper 3 whole cloves 6 cups cold water      In a large stockpot or Dutch oven place chicken pieces, celery, carrot,   onion, salt, pepper and cloves.  Add the water.  Bring to boiling. Reduce   heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove chicken. Strain stock. Discard   vegetables.  Clarify stock, if desired (see note below). If using the stock   while hot, skim fat.  (OR, chill stock and lift off fat. [*much, much*   easier, if you have the time to chill it, IMHO]).      Makes about 4 1/2 cups stock.      CROCK POT DIRECTIONS: Use ingredients as above, except use only 4 cups   water.  Combine all ingredients in an electric slow crockery cooker. Cover;   cook on low-heat setting for 8 to 10 hours. Strain stock. Discard   vegetables.  Continue as directed above.      NOTES ON CLARIFYING STOCK: Clarify beef or chicken stock for a clear soup.   Clarifying remove solid flecks that are too small to be strained out with   cheesecloth, but that will muddy a soup's appearance. To clarify, combine   1/4 cup cold water, 1 egg white and 1 eggshell, crushed. Add to stained   stock; bring to boiling. Remove from heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Strain   again through a sieve line with cheesecloth.      [My notes:  I usually don't have a bunch of 'bony' chicken pieces laying   around the house.  When I make my chicken stock, I just throw the whole   darn chicken in the pot, cover it with water and boil for 1 hour.  If I   have the vegies to put in, wonderful; if not, tuff luck.  Even without the   vegies in the stock, the Mulligatawny is very good.  Not too hot or spicy,   but very flavorful.  The cut-up vegetables really fill up the soup bowl and   your tummy, as well!  Well worth the effort to make.  -sr]      [ Better Homes & Gardens New Cook Book ]      Posted by Shelley Rodgers. Courtesy of Fred Peters.

Allow to soak overnight. The next   morning (start early - beans like to take their time), pour off the soaking   water, and ham bone, 8 cups of water, onion and seasonings. Put on the back   of the stove and let simmer gently until beans are very tender, usually   about 4 hours. Add more water if needed. Remove and discard ham bone. If   the water looks a bit scant pour in 1-2 cups more. When beans are good and   tender remove about a cupful of the beans and mash well with some of the   bean liquid. (This can be done in a blender, of course.) Return mashed   beans to pot, taste for seasoning, and serve steaming hot over freshly   cooked white rice.

In a soup kettle, combine chicken and   salted water. Bring to a boil. Skim surface. Add carrots, celery, onion,   dill and pepper to the hot broth. Cover and simmer until meat is tender and   vegetables are cooked -- about two hours. Strain and refrigerate. Remove   the fat that congeals on top and discard. Serve soup with noodles or rice,   cooked separately or in the strained broth. Microwave method: Gilletz   prefers this method, because all the ingredients and can be added at once   and there is no need to skim the broth. In a bowl, pour boiling water over   chicken. Trim off excess fat. Place chicken in a five-quart microwave-safe   casserole. Cut carrots and celery into chunks. Add to chicken along with   onion, dill and seasonings. cover with water. To prevent boiling over, take   care water remains 1 1/2 inches below top of the casserole. Cover casserole   and microwave at high (100 %) power for 30 ~ 35 minutes or until soup is   boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium power for 25 ~ 30 minutes. Let stand   covered for 15 - 20 minutes. Strain soup. Serve as above. From The Gazette,   91/01/16.
