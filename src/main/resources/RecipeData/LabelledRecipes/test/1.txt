Add shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs, water and   chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric mixer at low speed,   scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2 minute.  Increase speed to high and beat   an additional 3 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter into 2   greased and waxed-paper lined 9-inch round cake pans. Bake in a preheated   350ï¿½F. Oven for 35 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pans on racks   for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely on the racks. Place   one cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate   Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides and top of the cake   with the remaining Sour Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR CREAM/CHOCOLATE   FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine, confectioners' sugar,   and sour cream in a mixing bowl; blend well. Add chocolate which has been   melted and cooled and vanilla.  Beat until smooth. NOTE: I have seen   reference to people having trouble with their layer cakes and how they   rise.  Try this little trick when making this cake. Take the layer that has   the least amount of rise on the top and trim it to be flat with a sharp   knife.  Place the trimmed side down (layer should be upside down). Then   frost between layers and place the other layer on right side up and   finished frosting.  It will give the illusion of having a cake with only   one domed layer and will sit better on your cake plate. Also the trimmings   are great eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

1/2 c  Sourdough starter   1 1/2 c  All purpose flour       2 c  Sugar     3/4 c  Powdered cocoa (not instant)       2 ts Baking powder       2 ts Baking soda       1 c  Milk     1/2 c  Vegetable oil     3/4 c  Cold coffee       1 ts Vanilla     Few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce   something that's not possible with a mix.  This sourdough chocolate cake   falls in that category.  It's got a fudge-like quality you can't get any   way except with sourdough and since it's all mixed in one bowl, it's almost   as easy as a boxed cake.      Put the starter in a large bowl, cover loosely and allow to stand at room   temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour.  Then add the   rest of the ingredients, in the order given, beating well after each   addition.  It is not necessary to sift or premix any of the ingredients as   long as you are careful to get the baking powder and soda evenly mixed.      Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, pour in the batter, which will   be thin, and bake in a preheated 350ï¿½. oven for about 30 minutes, or until   the layers test done when poked with a toothpick.  The cake will have   pulled away from the sides of the pan.      Allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans, then finish   cooling the layers on wire racks.  Do not frost until the cake is   completely cold.      A mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake.      From: Pitzer, Sara _Baking with Sourdough_ Garden Way Publishing, 1980.

2 c  Coarsely chopped pecans     1/4 c  Packed light brown sugar       2 ts Ground cinnamon       1 ts Ground nutmeg       1 c  Unsalted butter       2 ts Plus 2 tsp vanilla extract       2 c  Sugar       3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour       2 ts Baking powder       1 c  Plus 2 tbsp milk       3    Egg whites     Grease and flour three 8" round cake pans (1 1/2" deep). Place the pecans   in a large ungreased roasting pan. Roast nuts @ 425 degrees for 10 minutes,   stirring occasionally. Watch, carefully, lower heat, if necessary.   Meanwhile, in a medium size bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg.   Then, mix in 4 tbsp of butter. Add 2 cups roasted pecans to the butter   mixture. Coat them thoroughly. Return mixture to the pan and roast for 10   minutes more, stirring once or twice. Stir in 2 tbsp vanilla extract and   roast 5 minutes more. Remove from oven and set aside. In a large bowl of an   electric mixer, cream 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar on high speed   until very light and fluffy, about 6 to 8 minutes. In a separate bowl, sift   together flour and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine milk and   remaining 2 tsp vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and the milk   mixture, alternately, to the butter, beating on high speed until well   blended and scraping the bowl sides between additions. Stir in the pecans.   In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites on high speed until frothy, about   30 seconds. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating until mixture   holds peaks, about 2 minutes. Gently, fold egg white mixture into the   batter, one third at a time. Spoon batter into prepared cake pans and   spread batter so that it is slightly lower in the center. Bake @ 350   degrees until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, about   40 minutes. Let cool 1 minute, then carefully remove from the pans and   place on a wire rack. Cool thoroughly. Glaze. Spread generously with   frosting between layers and on top and sides.  
1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar     3/4 c  Water       8    Egg yolks   1 1/2 c  Margarine, softened   2 1/2 c  Powdered sugar   4 1/2 ts Vanilla extract   2 1/2 c  Pecans; coarsely chopped     Use margarine rather than butter in this frosting because butter tends to   melt out of the frosting as the cake sits awhile. Roast pecans until dark,   then cool. Combine the granulated sugar and water in a 1 quart saucepan.   Cook over medium heat to soft thread stage (230 degrees on a candy   thermometer), about 15 minutes. Do not Stir. In a large bowl of an electric   mixer, beat egg yolks on high speed just slightly, about 5 seconds.   Gradually, add the hot sugar water mixture. Beat until thoroughly cool,   thick, shiny and very pale, about 10 minutes. Start at low speed so it   won't splash; then go to high speed. If crystal sugar builds up around the   sides of the bowl, don't scrape it into the mixture, it will make the   frosting lumpy and you will have plenty of frosting without it. Gradually,   add the margarine and mix on medium speed until completely blended and very   smooth, about 5 minutes. Blend in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract on   low speed until smooth, then, add the pecans. Beat on high speed until   thoroughly mixed and very thick. If frosting is too thick, thin with a   little cream, milk or water.  
1 c  Water     1/2 c  Sugar       1 ts Vanilla extract     For the glaze: Combine water and sugar in a small saucepan; bring to a   boil. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

1 lb Rice flour       3 c  Granulated sugar       3 c  Coconut milk       1 ts Lemon juice       1 ts Active dry yeast       1 ts Water       1    Wine rice ball, crushed to a            -powder     Combine 3 tablespoons of the rice flour, 1/4 cup of the coconut milk, and   1/2 teaspoon of yeast with the wine rice ball.  Cover and allow to stand at   room temperature for three hours.      Cook 2 1/2 cups of the coconut milk with the sugar just long enough to melt   the sugar.  Remove from the heat and cool.      After the yeast-rice flour mixture has rested for three hours, combine it   with the coconut milk-sugar mixture.  Mix well, cover, and allow to rest at   room temperature for another 3 hours.  At the end of the resting time,   combine the mixture with the remaining coconut milk, lemon juice, and the   remaining 1/2 teaspoon of yeast, which should first be dissolved in the   teaspoon of water.  Transfer to several small bowls or pans so that the   mixture fills it only halfway to allow room for expansion. Let stand   overnight, at room temperature. The following day, steam [using the wet   steaming method as described on page 36] for 30 minutes.      Serve the cake either hot, cold, or at room temperature.      Note: A wine rice ball can be purchased in Oriental grocery stores. They   are about the size of a camphor ball, and white.  To crush, use a rolling   pin or a blender.      Steaming      A steamer consists of a pot in which water is boiled and at least two more   metal inserts or layers that fit directly on the lower pot of water, one   above the other.  These inserts are perforated, allowing wet steam to   circulate freely through the layers and enabling either a large quantity of   one food or several different foods to be cooked at the same time.

Preheat oven to 400ï¿½F. In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking   powder, and salt. In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the   melted butter until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet   with the dry ingredients and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the   dough out onto a well floured board and knead for a minute or so. Divide   the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll out to to   fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2 lightly oiled   pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until dough is golden brown. In the   meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining 3 T sugar in   a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.  Allow the baked dough to cool   until it is just warm to the touch. Place 1 round on a serving plate,   spread it with the berries, and top with the other round of dough. Cut into   wedges to serve; this is best served fresh and warm. Top each serving with   a bit of cold, stiffly beaten heavy cream if you'd like.

5    Egg whites @ room temp     1/4 ts Cream of tartar     1/4 ts Salt       1 ts Vanilla   1 1/4 c  Sugar     Grease & flour 2 baking sheets.  Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt,   & vanilla in a large bowl.  Beat (at medium speed if a mixer is used) until   egg whites hold soft peaks.  Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar, a tablespoon at a   time, beating continuously.  Continue beating until meringue is very stiff   and dull.  It has been beaten enough when a bit, rubbed between thumb &   finger, is no longer grainy.  The meringue should be stiff enough to hold   it's shape when formed with a pastry tube.  Gently fold in remaining sugar.      Meringues should actually be dried rather than baked.  Herein lies the   secret of making meringues which are tender, delicate, and light-colored,   rather than overly crisp, tough, and too dark to be either attractive or   delicious.  The best meringues are baked by the following method:      Set oven teperature at 200 degrees before beginning to beat the egg whites.   After shaping the meringue mixture on baking sheets, place in the preheated   oven for 15 minutes.  Then turn off the oven heat.  Allow the meringues to   remain in the oven with the heat rurned off for at least 4-5 hours -- the   longer the better.  If your oven has a pilot light, the meringues will be   ready a little sooner.  The meringues should be totally dry before removing   them from the oven.  If you can, leave them in the oven overnight.      For many of us, however, time is a factor.  If you can't take the time to   bake meringues this slow, slow way, accept second best & simply bake them   slowly, setting the oven temperature for 200 degrees or less if possible.   At 200 degrees, meringue layers will need to bake for about 40 minutes;   small meringues may take a little less time.      Whatever method you use, it is important to prevent the meringues from   coloring, since even a light tan color changes their texture and taste as   well as their appearance.      When thoroughly dry, meringues can be kept covered in a dry airy place (NOT   in a tightly covered box) for several weeks.      ALTERNATE MIXING METHOD by ELECTRIC BEATER      Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla in   large bowl.  Beat at high speed until egg whites hold peaks.

1 lb Bittersweet chocolate; coar            -sely chopped     1/2 lb Butter; unsalted       6    Eggs; lightly beaten            Chocolate ganache glaze     2/3 c  Heavy cream       6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate; finel            -y chopped     Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:   :15 CHOCOLATE   MOUSSE CAKE: 1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Wrap the outside of an 8-inch   springform  pan in a double layer of aluminum foil to prevent seepage.    Butter the pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or waxed   paper.  Butter the paper. 2. Combine the chocolate and butter in a large   metal bowl over a pan of hot - not simmering - water (the bottom of the   bowl should not touch the water). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until   the chocolate is smooth and melted. Or melt in a glass bowl in a microwave   oven on high (100%), stopping and stirring every 15 seconds; remove the   chocolate when there are still a few lumps and stir until completely   smooth. 3. Put the eggs in a large mixer bowl set over simmering water and   stir constantly until warm to the touch, about 3 minutes; remove from the   heat.  With an electric mixer, beat the eggs until they triple in volume   and form soft peaks when the beater is lifted, 5 to 8 minutes. (To ensure   maximum volume, if using a hand-held mixer, continue to beat the eggs over   simmering water until they are hot to the touch, about 5 minutes, then   remove from the heat and beat until cool.) 4. Fold half the eggs into the   melted chocolate until partially incorporated. Add the remaining eggs and   fold until they are just blended and no streaks remain. 5. Pour at once   into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.   Place in a larger roasting pan and add enough hot water to the pan to reach   about two-thirds of the way up the springform. 6. Bake for 5 minutes. Cover   the top of the springform loosely with lightly buttered aluminum foil and   bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool on a   rack for 45 minutes; then cover and refrigerate until chilled and very   firm, about 3 hours. 7. To unmold, run a small spatula or a blunt knife   around the edge and remove the side of the springform. Carefully invert the   cake into a plate that has been covered with plastic wrap and remove the   bottom of the springform; peel off the parchment. Reinvert the cake onto a   cardboard round or a cake plate.  Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or   overnight, until thoroughly chilled, before serving. 8. If you want to   cover the cake with a chocolate ganache glaze, set it on a rack or tuck   strips of waxed paper around the bottom of the cake. Pour the tepid glaze   onto the center of the cake, letting it cascade over the sides. Run a long   metal spatula lightly across the top so that the glaze will not be too   thick.  If necessary, use the spatula to patch any pare spots. Work quickly   before the glaze sets. Prick any air bubbles with a needle or pin.   Carefully remove any strips of waxed paper. Let the glaze stand undisturbed   until set, 2 to 3 hours at room temperature, or 30 minutes in the   refrigerator. CHOCOLATE GANACHE GLAZE: 1. In a small heavy saucepan, scald   the cream.  Remove from the heat and immediately add the chopped chocolate.   Cover and let stand for 5 minutes; then stir gently until the chocolate is   fully melted and smooth. Let cool until tepid. 2. Stir the glaze to test   it.  It is ready to use when a small amount mounds just a tiny bit when   dropped from the spoon before disappearing into the mixture. If the glaze   is too thick and the mound remainds on the surface, add warm water (or   liqueur) by the teaspoonful, testing until the consistency is correct. If   for some reason the glaze remains too thin, stir in more finely grated   chocolate, heat until melted and then let cool again. Variations      MINI-MOUSSE CAKE: This cake is perfect for serving 6 to 8. Make the   Ultimate chocolate Mousse Cake, using 1/2 pound chocolate, 4 ounces of   butter and 3 lightly beaten eggs. Bake in a 6-inch springform pan;   temperature and baking remain the same. MOCHA FUDGE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the   Ultimate Chocolate Mousse cake, prefereably using extra-bittersweet   chocolate.  In step 2, add 2 tablespoons instant expresso powder to the   melted chocolate and butter.  In step 5, pour halfe the chocolate mousse   batter into the prepared springform pan and drizzle with have the Hot fudge   (see recipe).  Add the remaining batter and drizzle on the remaining fudge.   PRALINE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake,   preferably using extra-bittersweet chocolate. In Step 2, add 1/2 cup   praline paste (see note) to the melted chocolate and butter. Garnish, if   desired with toasted hazelnuts. (Toasted pecans are also nice). NOTE:   Praline paste can be ordered from Maison Glass, 52 E. 58th St., New York,   NY 10022; 212 755-3316. CHOCOLATE FRUIT MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Ultimate   Chocolate Mousse Cake, preferably using extra-bittersweet chocolate. In   Step 2, add 3/4 cup raspberry jelly or melted and strained apricot jam to   the melted chocolate and butter.    Garnish the cake with a sparkling glaze of 1/2 cup melted raspberry jelly   or strained appricot jam mixed with 1 Tablespoon framboise (raspberry   eau-de-vie).  Spoon this glaze over the top of the cake and immediately   spread into a thin, even layer with a long, narrow spatula. BRANDIED CHERRY   CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Brandied Cherrys (see recipe) at least a   day ahead.  Make the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake (using semi-sweet   chocolate). After Step 4, fold in 1 cup halved, well-drained brandied   cherrys.

1    9 Inch Chocolate Layer Cake       2 lb Semi-Sweet Chocolate       8 oz White Fondant       2 c  Whipping Cream     With a serrated knife or thread, cut cake into two layers and place one   layer in a 9 inch springform pan. In a double boiler, over hot water, melt   chocolate and fondant. Or, use a microwave oven to melt the ingredients,   allowing 12 minutes for chocolate, 20 seconds for fondant - medium power.   Heat 1/2 cup cream to lukewarm. If using a microwave, allow 30 seconds.   Beat the remaining chilled cream until it forms soft peaks; set aside. In a   large bowl, combine warm cram with fondant and melted chocolate. Stir until   ingredients are evenly blended and the temperature is reduced to lukewarm.   Beat the soft chocolate mixture and gradually incorporate the whipped   cream. Spoon one-half of the creamy chocolate mixture over cake. Top with   second layer of cake. Complete by spreading the second half of the   chocolate mixture over top. Refrigerate the cake for 8 to 12 hours. Serve   chilled with whipped cream and chocolate curls. Serves 16.

Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after   each addition.  Gradually add sugar; beat at high speed until light and   fluffy.  By nad, stir in flour, dry frosting mix, and wlanuts until well   blended.  Bake in greased and floured 12 cup bundt pan at 350ï¿½F for 60 to   65 minutes.  Since the cake has the soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary doneness   tests can not be used.  Test after 60 minutes by observing a dry, shiny   brownie-type crust.  Cool 30 minutes; remove from pan to wire rack or   serving plate.  Cake will have a moist center called the Tunnel of Fudge.

Although the   frosting mix was discontinued, Pillsbury continued to receive so many   requests for the cake that the company developed a scratch recipe to   simulate the original.  Here it is:"      1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup bundt pan or 10" angel   food tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a large bowl, beat   together butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until   light and fluffly, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well   after each addition.  Gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar, beating until   well blended.  By hand, stir in flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, and nuts; mix until   well blended. Spoon batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. 3. Bake 58   to 62 minutes.  Since this cake has a soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary   doneness test cannot be used.  Accurate oven temperature and baking time   are critical.  Let cake cool upright in pan on a rack for 1 hour; then   invert onto serving plate and let cool completely. 4. To make glaze, in a   small bowl, combine remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar, remaining 1/4 cup   cocoa, and milk.  Mix until well blended. Spoon glaze over top of cool   cake, allowing some to run down sides. Store cake tightly covered.      ** Nuts are essential for the success of this recipe.

And it's quick and easy, too!      First, prepare the pan: Melt 1/3 cup butter in heavy 10" skillet or baking   dish.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup brown sugar evenly over butter. Arrange drained,   cooked fruit in attractive pattern on the butter-sugar coating.      Make the cake batter and pour it over fruit.  Bake until wooden pick thrust   into center of cake comes out clean.  Immediately turn upside-down on   serving plate.  Do not remove pan for a few minutes.  Brown sugar mixture   will run down over cake instead of clinging to pan. Serve warm with plain   or whipped cream.      Note:  I recommend pineapple slices, with maraschino cherries studded in   between for fruit. -Perry-      Cake batter: Beat until thick and lemon colored (5 min)      TEMPERATURE:   350 degrees F.

Top with   the remaining cakes and press together so that the filling squashes out the   sides a little.      NOTE:      Because of all the butter in the filling, these pies should not be held at   room temperature indefinitely.  Pies that are not to be eaten soon after   baking should be wrapped in plastic film and refrigerated or frozen for   future use.      From Comfort Food by Holly Garrison  Copyright 1988

Orange Glaze: Stir together til smooth.      Note: Avoid using dry old dates. For slightly softer cake texture, add 2   Tbsp melted butter to batter before folding into squash.  This will add 2   grams fat per serving. From: The Spectator....Aug 12/92 There is yellow   squash hidden in this cake, but you'd never guess it. It's delicate,   faintly sweet flavor blends right in. You can use crook neck, straight neck   or even yellow zucchini, but be sure to select young squach with soft, thin   skins. (why not green zucchini?) This cake, with its accent of chopped   dates, needs only a simple icing to dress it up To add extra moistness and   a sweet citrus flavour, poke all over the warm cake and pour optional glaze   over the cake til it soaks in.      Adapted from a rich recipe with sour cream and pecans created by the late   Bert Greene.
