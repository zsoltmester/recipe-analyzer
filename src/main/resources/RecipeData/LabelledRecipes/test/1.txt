      2    Envelopes Unflavored
           -Gelatin
      2 tb -Cold Water
    1/2 c  -Boiling Water
      2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla
           Flour
    3/4 lb Chocolate for dipping
           Regal Icing
  Put gelatin in top of double boiler; add cold water.  When gelatin
  softens, add boiling water and stil well.  Add sugar and salt.  Put
  over boiling water and stir until sugar dissolves completely.
  Pour into large bowl of electric mixer and beat at high speed until
  misture is thick but not as stiff as beaten egg whites.  Add vanilla.
  Meanwhile, spread flour 2" deep in a large pan.  Push an egg (in
  shell) into the flour  at intervals, making hollow spaces in which to
  mold the marshmallow mixture.
  Drop marshmallow mixture into the flour molds.  Sprinkle flour
  lightly over top and put in cold place until set.  Remove mixture
  from one mold and you have a  half-egg.  Trim the flat side of
  marshmallow half-egg to make it even.  You can dip it in melted
  chocolate to cover and decorate with Regal Icing.
  Or you can put two halves together to make an egg, as follows:  Dip
  the rounded part of a half-egg in melted chocolate; set aside to
  cool, flat (uncoated) side down.  Trim flat side of second half-egg
  (to make it even), lift from mold and completely coat with chocolate.
  Quickly press its flat side against the flat side of the cooled
  half-egg and you have a whole egg. The chocolate will hold it
  together.
  When chocolate-coated eggs are cool, trim with Regal Icing put
  through cake decorator tube.  Make ruffles around them to cover seam
  where the two halves join and to provide decoration.  Write names of
  children on their eggs with the icing, or decorate with tiny designs
  pressed through fine tips of a cake decorator tube.  Frosting my be
  left white or tinted in pastel colors.  Makes 13 eggs (or 26
  half-eggs).

      Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 1 servings
      3 oz Chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Powdered sugar
      2 tb Fresh cream
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by
  skimming the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to
  settle. Melt butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler,
  stirring to mix well. When melted, remove the double boiler from the
  fire, leaving the hot water in the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift
  the powdered sugar in slowly, so that it will not form lumps,
  stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool place. (In winter, 12
  hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time, cut a piece of
  this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife or spoon.
  Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of the
  bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles
  are better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into
  balls, you can also shape them to look more like truffles.

  week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable shortening for the
  butter.

  Fudge was popular in the 19 th cntury at women's colleges. These
  recipes come froma booklet in 1905.
  Combine sugar, coarsely chopped chocolate, and cream.  Cook
  overmoderate heat, stirring only until sugar and chocolate have
  melted.  Continue cooking until mixture reaches 238 degrees or until
  a few drops tested in cold water form a soft ball. Remove from heat,
  add butter, and cool slightly. Beat until fudge begins to harden,
  then transfer to a buttered platter. Cut intosquares before the fudge
  is absolutely firm. Makes a little more than 1 pound. VARIATIONS: To
  make Wellesley Fudge, add 1/2 lb of marshmallows when the candy is
  removed from the heat.
      Title: Vinegar Taffy
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Vanilla or other flavoring
           -such as orange or lemon, or
           -use:
    1/2 ts Peppermint or:
      1 oz Bitter chocolate, grated
  From Grandma Ruby's recipe file: newspaper clipping
  Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of
  the mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a
  candy thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle
  flavoring over top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward
  the center until cool and firm enough to handle.
  Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and
  fingers are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to
  pull taffy. When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with
  both hands. Fold over and pull out again.
  As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will
  become stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand.  Pull until
  it is difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.
  Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors
  and roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store
  cooled taffy in an air tight container in a cool dry place.
  If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
  Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water.  Stir until dissolved and
  then recook according to original directions.
  Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added
  as the taffy is being pulled.
  I wish I had a date for this...I'd say recipe is at _least_ 30 years
  old...possibly 40, maybe even more...  This is a lesson to all of you
  to date your recipes, including newspaper clippings!

      Title: White Chocolate-Coffee Truffles
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 6 servings
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Instant espresso or coffee
           -powder
     14 oz White chocolate, very finely
           -chopped
      2 tb Kahlua
           Dipping chocolate:
      1 lb White chocolate, very finely
           -chopped
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      3 tb Chocolate-covered coffee
           -beans, very finely chopped
  1. To make the truffles: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and
  espresso powder to a boil.  pour over the chocolate and whisk until
  completely melted.  whisk in the Kahlua. Refrigerate until completely
  chilled and firm.
  2. With a tsp, place pieces of the chocolate onto a foil-lined baking
  sheet.  Refrigerate to firm; roll into balls and refrigerate again for
  about 30 minutes.
  3. To prepare the dipping chocolate: In the top of a double boiler
  set over hot water, place the chocolate and oil. stir until almost
  melted. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir
  until the chocolate has completely melted.  continue to stir until
  the chocolate has cooled and reaches a temperature of 90 degrees.
  4. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with aluminum foil.  Dip each
  candy center in the melted chocolate, shake off the excess and place
  on the baking sheet.  When you have dipped a row of candies, top each
  with a little of the chocolate- covered coffee bean.  Before each
  dipping, stir the chocolate vigorously with your fingers.  If the
  centers become too soft, chill for about 30 minutes.
  5. Let the candies set for about 2 hours before storing in
  refrigeration. If the centers start to come through the bottoms of
  the chocolates, as often happens with soft mixtures, dip the bottoms
  again in melted and cooled chocolate.

  hour. Chill clean mixing bowl and beaters.
  Beat remaining Truffle Cream in chilled bowl for 1 1/2 minutes.
  Remove cake from refrigerator and spread cream over top and sides.
  Remove tiles from refrigerator.  Trim the tiles to fit height of

  "Recipes for this no-bake treasure appear in countless cookbook as
  Chocolate Fridge Cake, New York Slice, Miracle Bars, Ribbon Squres
  and many other names. But the origin of Nanaimo Bars is still a hot
  topic of debate. The Woman's Auxiliary to the Nanaimo Hospital Cook
  Book (1952) included three similar recipes (two called Chocolate
  Squares and one Chocolate Slice). These recipes appeared under the
  name Nanaimo Bars in the Vancouver Sun in the early 50's and in the
  B.C. Women's Institute Centennial of B.C. Cookbook in 1958. The test
  kitchens of food companies developed various versions with their own
  products. Since the 50s, endless variations include Minted, Grand
  Marnier, Cherry, Pina Colada, Mocha, and Peanut Butter Nanaimo
  Bars...During the 50s, a Dairy Food Service Bureau recipe called
  Dominoes suggested piping a little bit of the middle layer into dots
  on top to give a domino pattern when cut."
  Bottom Layer: In double boiler, melt butter, sugar and cocoa; add egg
  and cook until thickened. Add crumbs, nuts and coconut. Press into
  ungreased 9 inch square pan.
   Middle Layer: Beat together butter, cream, custard powder and sugar;

  Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy
  bar. The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
  considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby
  cut- ting the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness
  is worth the extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift
  together flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats
  and brown sugar. Beat egg whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in
  Raisin Puree. Stir into flour mixture along with chocolate, walnuts,
  and orange zest just until blended. Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
      2 c  Firmly Packed Light Brown
           Sugar
      2 c  White Sugar (Or You Can Use
           All White Sugar)
      1 c  Milk
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate
  Old Method:
  Stir constantly all the time it is boiling.  Flavor with vanilla (1
  Tsp). After you take it off the stove, stir until it is almost hard,
  then pour into a buttered pan. (NOTE: This is a paraphrased recipe
  from a very old cookbook)
  Modern Method:
  Butter the sides of a 3-quart saucepan, prewarm the candy
  thermometer. Use the same ingredients as above but substitute 1 cup
  Half and Half for the milk.  Dump in the pan. Stir constantly until
  the sugar is dissolved and it comes to a boil.  Reduce the heat while
  retaining the boil and continue cooking, stirring infrequently if at
  all. When it reaches the soft ball stage, around 234 to 240 degrees
  F. (112 to 115.5 degrees C.) remove from the heat and flavor with 1
  tsp of vanilla. Do not shock immediately (NOTE: The shocking is done
  by putting the pan in a large square pan full of ice or cold water).
  However, when the fudge cools on top (hold your hand over the candy
  to check) place the pan in cool water to equalize the heat between
  the bottom and top of the pan. Stir gently, it will candy almost
  immediately; pour into a buttered 8 X 8-inch pan. SERVES 4 OR 1

  Contributed to the echo by: Keith Ker White Chocolate Cheesecake
  Soften the cream cheese in the microwave. Melt the chocolate in a
  double boiler. Be careful not to get any water at all in the white
  chocolate as it changes the consistency. Hershey's white chocolate
  bars can be used for the white chocolate. Add sugar and eggs to cream
  cheese and blend a bit. Blend in the chocolate. Pour the mixture into
  a graham cracker crust and bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Let
  cool slightly in oven with heat off and door slightly ajar.

  a dough is formed, and stir in the hazelnuts and chocolate chips.
    Turn out the dough onto a floured surface, knead it several times
  and halve it. Working on a large buttered and floured baking sheet,
  with floured hands, form each piece of dough into a flattish log 12
  inches long by 2 inches wide and arrange the logs at least 3 inches
  apart on the sheet.
    Bake the logs in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 35 minutes
  and let them cool on the baking sheet on a rack for about 10 minutes.
  Reduce the oven temperature to 300F. On a cutting board, cut the logs
  crosswise on the diagonal into 3/4 inch slices , arrange the
  biscotti, cut sides down, on the baking sheet, and bake them for 5 to
  6 minutes on each side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the
  biscotti to racks to cool and store them in airtight containers.

  Gateaux Jos. Louis
  Home-made versions of this best selling commercial snacking cake turn
  up in recipe collections throughout the Beauce. A product of the
  giant Vachon bakery at St. Marie, it was launched by founder-bakers
  Arcade and Rose-Anna Vachon who named it for their eldest two sons
  Joseph and Louis and not, as some believe , after the heavyweight
  boxing champion, Joe Louis. Home recipes use a drop-cookie method and
  ~sometimes- a marshmallow filling. The baking cake is made
  automatically with a diameter of 3 1/2 inches (9 cm). To achieve a
  symmetrical look and a light texture, I adapted a recipe belonging to
  Mariette Scully Bourque of Notre Dame des Pins to the muffin tin.
  CAKE: Grease 12 medium muffin tins or 24 small ones. In a large bowl,
  cream butter and sugar together until fluffy. Measure milk into a 1
  cup measure and stir in vinegar, then baking soda. In another bowl,
  sift or mix together flour, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt.
  Combine dry ingredients with butter mixture with milk; stir in
  vanilla. Fill prepared muffin tins half full of batter. Bake in a
  preheated 350F oven for about 10 minutes or until a tester inserted
  in centre comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in pan. Turn out onto
  rack and cool completely.
  VANILLA FILLING: In top of a double boiler, set over boiling water,
  combine egg whites, granulated sugar, salt and water. With an
  electric mixer, beat until stiff and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes.
  Remove from heat and beat in vanilla.
  CHOCOLATE ICING: Cream soft butter with cocoa powder. Blend in cream
  and vanilla. Stir in sifted icing (confectioner's) sugar until icing
  is of spreading consistency.
  Slice cakes in half horizontally. Fill with Vanilla Filling and
  spread tops and sides with Chocolate Icing.
