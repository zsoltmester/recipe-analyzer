  1 3/4 c  Sugar                                    Pillsbury Chocolate Chip
    1/2 ts Salt                                     - Cookie Dough (large size)
      2 c  Half & Half                              - OR homeade cookie dough
      1 tb Vanilla Extract                
 
  Take the chocolate cookie dough out of fridge and leave out till needed.
  Scald milk until bubbles form around edge. Remove from heat. Add sugar and
  salt. Stir until dissolved. Stir in half and half, vanilla, and whipping
  cream. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Freeze as directed by your ice
  cream machine's instructions. Once ice cream has been through the entire
  ice cream machine process and is now a chilled soft ice cream, add the
  chocolate chip cookie dough. Just break up the dough as best you can with
  your hands and drop it in small clusters into the soft ice cream. Try to
  mix it around to ensure that the cookie dough is evenly distributed
  throughout the ice cream. Put the ice cream in the freezer for several
  hours until hardened. Origin: We pretty much took our vanilla ice cream
  recipe and added the chocolate chip cookie dough. You can easily use the
  Pillsbury cookie dough, but it's cheaper and better to use homemade. Our
  Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough recipe makes this especially
  yummy!

      Title: Chocolate Devastation  (part 1)
 Categories: Chocolate, Desserts, Alcohol, Ice cream
   Servings: 12
 
-------------------------CHOCOLATE RAISIN ICE CREAM-------------------------
      2 c  Raisins                             1 c  Half & half
    1/2 c  Jack Daniel's whiskey               2 oz Unsweet chocolate
      8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate                8    Egg yolks
      2 c  Heavy cream                       1/4 c  Sugar

-------------------------------MOCHA MERINGUE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar                    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch                          2 ts Instant espresso
      1 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder          1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      8    Egg whites                        1/8 ts Salt

----------------------------BITTERSWEET GANACHE----------------------------
      2 c  Heavy cream                         8 oz Semi-sweet chocolate
      2 tb Unsalted butter                     4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2 tb Sugar                          
 
  Combine the raisins and whiskey in a plastic container with a tight fitting
  lid. Allow to stand at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight. Heat 1
  inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place
  8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, 1/2 cup heavy cream, and 2 ounces
  unsweetened chocolate in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover
  the top with ilm wrap. Heat for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and
  stir until smooth. Transfer to a stainless steel bowl and set aside until
  needed. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 c heavy cream and the half-and-half in a 2
  1/2-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the cream to a boil. While
  the cream is heating, place 8 egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in the bowl of an
  electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the eggs on high for 2 to 2 1/2
  minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Continue to beat on high until
  slightly thickened and lemon-colored, about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. (At this
  point, the cream should be boiling. If not, adjust the mixer speed to low
  and continue to mix until the cream boils. If this is not done, the egg
  yolks will develop undesirable lumps.) Pour the boiling cream into the
  beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine. Return to the saucepan and heat over
  medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the cream reaches a
  temperature of 185~, 2-4 minutes. Then pour into the melted chocolate
  mixture, and stir to combine. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath to a
  temperature of 40-45~, about 15-20 minutes. Line 2, 8" cake pans with
  enough film wrap to cover the insides of the pan. Set aside until needed.
  Fold the whiskey-soaked raisins and any residual liquid into the cooled
  chocolate custard mixture. Freeze in an ice cream freezer following the
  manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the semi-frozen ice cream to the 2
  cake pans, evenly dividing the ice cream between the two pans. Use a rubber
  spatula to spread the ice cream evenly to the edges of the pans. Tightly
  cover the tops of the pans with film wrap, then place in the freezer for at
  least 12 hours before assembling the cake. See part 2 for rest of
  directions.

      Title: Chocolate Devastation (part 2)
 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate, Ice cream
   Servings: 12
 
           - directions continued         
 
  MOCHA MERINGUE: Using a 9" cake circle (or cake plate) as a guide, trace a
  circle on each of 3 sheets of parchment paper (cut to fit the baking
  sheets) with a pencil. Turn each sheet of parchment paper over and place
  with the trace mark down on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 250~.
  Combine together in a sifter the confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, and
  cocoa. Sift onto the wax paper and set aside until needed. Heat 1" of water
  in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium-high heat. Place 8 egg
  whites, 3/4 cup sugar, the espresso powder, the cream of tartar, and the
  salt in the top half of the double boiler. Heat the egg white mixture to a
  temperature of 120~ while gently and constantly whisking, about 2-3
  minutes. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with
  a balloon whip. Whisk on high until stiff but not dry, about 2 to 2 1/2
  minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in
  the sifted dry ingredients. Fill a pastry bag (with no tip) with about a
  third of the meringue. Fill a traced circle with meringue: start in the
  center and pipe a 1/2" wide spiral toward the ouside of the circle. Fill
  the pastry bag again and repeat this procedure with each of the 2 remaining
  circles (each circle should be filled with about a third of the original
  amount of meringue.) Place the meringues in the preheated oven and bake for
  1 hour. Reduce the oven temperature to 225~ and bake for an additional 2
  hours. Cool on baking sheets for 30 minutes before handling.
    THE GANACHE: Heat 2 cups heavy cream, the butter, and 2 tablespoons sugar
  in a 2 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir to dissolve
  the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. Place 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate and
  4 ounces unsweetened chocolate in a stainless bowl. Pour the boiling cream
  over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until smooth.
  Reserve 1 cup of ganache and set aside at room temperature. Pour the
  remaining amount of ganache onto a baking sheet with sides and refrigerate
  for 35-40 minutes. Pour 1/4 cup of the reserved room-temperature ganache
  onto the center of a baked meringue (supported by a cake circle). Remove an
  ice-cream disk from the freezer. Unwrap the disk and place it onto the
  puddle of ganache. Press down on the ice cream disk gently but firmly (this
  will spread the ganache). Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium-sized star
  tip with one-third of the chilled ganache. Pipe about 28-30 individual
  vertical strips 1 1/2" long and 3/4" wide--all the way around the side of
  the ice cream disk (each strip should be touching the other, and each strip
  should also be wider at the base where it touches the meringue and tapered
  at the crest where it rises to the top edge of the ice cream disk). Place
  this section into the freezer and repeat the preceding procedure with
  another meringue and ice cream disk. Place in the freezer after completion
  for about 10-15 minutes. Remove a meringue and ice cream section from the
  freezer. Pour 1/4 cup of room-temperature ganache onto the center of the
  ice cream. Remove the second section from the freezer, and center onto the
  first. Press down on the ice cream, gently but firmly, to spread the
  ganache. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup of room-temperature genache onto the
  top ice cream disk, and onto this ganache place the remaining baked
  meringue, once again pressing down gently but firmly to spread the ganache.
  Place the Devastation in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes. Fill a pastry
  bag fitted with a medium-sized star tip with the remaining chilled ganache.
  Remove the Devastation from the freezer. Starting 1/2" inside the edge of
  the top meringue, pipe a ring of about 28-30 individual strips--1 1/2" long
  and 3/4" wide--all the way around the top (each strip should be touching
  the other, and each strip should also be wider at the point closest to the
  edge and tapered at the point closest to the center). Return the completed
  Devastation to the freezer for at least 1 hour before serving. To serve,
  cut the Devastation with a serrated slicer. Heat the blade of the slicer
  under hot running water before making each slice. Allow the slices to come
