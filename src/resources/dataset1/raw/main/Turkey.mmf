  1 1/8 ts Garlic power
      3 tb Dried, minced onion
      8    Flour tortillas, 8 to 10"
    1/4 lb Thin sliced rst turkey*
 
  Soften cream cheese, drain can of chilies, set out other ingredients.
  Place cream cheese, milk, garlic, onion flakes, and salt in bowl.
  Beat until fluffy.  Stir in chilies and cilantro leaves.  Brush both
  sides of a tortilla with water.  Spread one side of torilla with thin
  layer of the cream cheese mixture.  Cover torilla with a layer of the
  sliced meat.
  Roll up and place on plate, repeat.  Cover plate with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate from 1 to 8 hours.  Cut into 1/2-inch slices and serve.
  Makes about 4 dozen appetizers.
  * Pre-packaged "Buddig" style meats work well for everyday occasions.
  # Many supermarkets now carry small plastic containers of spices at one
    price.  I've found that 1 container of cilantro (.15 oz) is
    satisfactory for most occasions, even though less than 3 Tablespoons.

      Title: PORTUGUESE ROAST TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1    (10-lb) fresh turkey
      2 lb Coarse (kosher) salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Garlic cloves
           - peeled and minced
      1 lb French or Italian bread
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
  3 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 lg Egg yolks
 
  REMOVE THE GIBLETS from the turkey for another use. Fill the neck and body
  cavities of the turkey with coarse salt, then rub the skin well all over
  with salt. Place the turkey and remaining coarse salt in a large deep
  kettle, adding enough cold water to just cover the bird. Set in a cool spot
  for 3 to 4 hours.
  
  TO PREPARE THE STUFFING: Put the butter and olive oil in a large heavy
  saute pan, or better yet, a kettle, and place it over moderate heat. When
  the butter is melted, add the garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes until limp.
  Meanwhile, tear the bread into small chunks. Add the bread and the fine
  salt and pepper and toss well. Pour in the chicken stock and beat hard with
  a wooden spoon until the mixture is pastelike. Turn the heat to its lowest
  point, cover the kettle and steam 15-to-20 minutes until the bread absorbs
  all the liquid. Add the egg yolks to the stuffing mixture and beat hard
  until smooth. Remove from the heat and reserve. Preheat oven to 400F. Drain
  the turkey and rinse several times in cool water so that all traces of salt
  are gone. Place the bird on the counter with the neck cavity facing you.
  With your hands, begin working the skin free from the breast. Proceed
  gently, taking care not to tear the skin. It's slow going at first, but
  once you begin to free the skin, the job goes quickly. Loosen it all the
  way down the bird to within about 1 inch of the tail end, down both sides.
  With your hands, push the stuffing bit by bit far down under the skin and
  continue, packing it in lightly, until the breast is covered with about a
  1-inch layer. Next fill the neck cavity, skewer the neck skin flat against
  the back to enclose, and truss the bird. Place the turkey breast-side up in
  a large shallow roasting pan without a rack and roast uncovered for about 2
  1/2 hours. Do not baste. When the bird is richly browned and a leg moves
  easily in the hip joint, remove from the oven. Let stand, uncovered, 20
  minutes. Drain drippings into a sauce boat and keep warm. Remove trussing
  string and skewers and serve at once on a warmed platter.

      Title: TURKEY TASSO
 Categories: Cajun, Poultry, Low-cal
      Yield: 15 servings
 
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Onion powder
      2 tb Ground black pepper
      1 tb Ground white pepper
      1 tb Ground cumin
      2 tb Liquid smoke
      2 tb Granulated garlic
      2 tb Ground red pepper
      2 tb Paprika
      2 ts Salt
      3 lb Skinned & boned turkey brea
 
  In a small bowl, combine the sugar, garlic, onion powder, red, white, and
  black peppers, paprika, salt and cumin, mixing well.  Place the turkey
  breast in a large glass bowl and sprinkle with 4 Tbsp of the mixture,
  coating well.  (store the remainder of the seasoning mix the a tight
  container for future use)
  
  Sprinkle the turkey with the liquid smoke, rubbing the seasoning mix and
  liquid over the entire breast.  Cover the bowl and marinate for two(2) days
  in the refrigerator, turning occasionally.
  
  Light the fire in a charcoal water smoker, cover, and let the heat and
  smoke accumulate.  When the smoker is ready, place the turkey breast on the
  wire rack and smoke for 7 hours.  Add water as needed.  Add a few mesquite
  chips every hour or so.  When the tasso is done, remove and set aside until
  cool enough to handle.  You will note it is very dry, almost like jerky.
  Don't worry, that's normal.  Store it in freezer bags up to one month in
  the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.
  
  note: This is not something you will really want to make a sandwich from.
  It is used primarily in gumbo, red beans, stuffings and some pasta dishes.
   It has a very pronounced flavor.  Basically, it can be used in place of
  smoked ham hocks or the like.  I like it by itself, but then I've been
  accused of having no taste buds left in my mouth because of the hot food I
  love to consume.

  La fricasee fatuguee
  
  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat. Add
  thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low heat,
  stirring often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well before
  adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce is smooth
  and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or chicken gravy.
  Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with hot biscuits and
  pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour and
  mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should remain
  lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a greased cookie
  sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.
  
  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the turkey
  was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in the oven
  until browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted homemade bread.
  So, when it came time to make hash from all the little bits and pieces, the
  children felt that the poor turkey must be tired (fatiguee), hence the
  name.

      1 cl Garlic, minced
      1 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper

  1.  Rinse turkey under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. 2.
  Preheat oven to 325F.  Pour 1/2 cup stock into roasting pan.  Heavily
  butter roasting rack and set in pan.  Fill turkey loosely with stuffing. 3.
  Combine garlic, basil, salt, pepper, rosemary, marjoram and thyme. Rub some
  of the butter over turkey.  Sprinkle evnly with herb mixture. 4. Place
  turkey breast side down on rack and roast for 20 minutes. 5. Melt remaining
  butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat.  Remove from heat and add
  wine. 6. After 20 minutes, baste turkey generously with butter and wine
  mixture and continue roasting according to wrapper directions. (If there
  are no directions with turkey, allow about 15 to 18 minutes per pound).
  Baste turkey generously with remaining wine mixture and pan juices every 30
  minutes or so, checking occasionally to make sure breast skin is not
  sticking to roasting rack.  Add additional 1/2 cup of stock if more liquid
  is needed for basting.   Cover turkey loosely with foil if it begins to
  brown too quickly. 7. During the last hour of cooking, turn turkey breast
  side up.  Test for doneness by moving leg; if it wiggles easily, turkey is
  done.  A meat thermometer inserted into thigh should read 180F to 185F. 8.
  Transfer turkey to large heated platter and cover loosely with foil. Let
  stand in warm place 15 to 20 minutes. 9. Meanwhile, prepare Giblet Gravy.

           -cut up with seeds and juice
           -baking tomatoes

---------------------------CUT UP IN SMALL PIECES---------------------------
      1 cn Whole tomatoes (bowl 3)

---------------------------------BOWL FOUR---------------------------------
      1 c  Cooked meat, flaked into
           -bite size chunks. Poultry -
           -chicken or turkey is
           -recommended, but experiment

---------------------------HAVE READY TO PREPARE---------------------------
      5 lg To 6 Garlic cloves, cleaned
           Ginger root (fresh)
      4 lg To 5 lg Bell Peppers,*
      3 lg To 4 lg Tomatoes,**
 
  * Green or Red, cored and rinsed of seeds ** cored and the insides spooned
  out into bowl 3. PREPARATION: In a large frying pan, heat pan and add olive
  oil. Press 2 cloves of garlic into oil, and stir. When it begins to cook,
  add Bowl #2 (carrots). Stir carefully, and when it stops spitting, add Bowl
  #1. Add soy to taste to mixture and toss. Let cook until onions start to
  clarify, stirring frequently. Add the fresh tomato bowl (Bowl #3) and stir
  until tomatoes are tender. Add the cooked tomatoes and juice, and stir in
  well. While cooking, grate the ginger, add the remaining garlic (crushed).
  When mixture begins to dry, add the spaghetti sauce, a dash of nutmeg, a
  dash of five spice powder, pepper, and the taco sauce mixture. Stir in the
  powder well. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes on simmer, and taste. Add
  crushed red peppers to desired taste, but sauce should be hot. I used about
  a 1/2 tsp. Add enough water to make it mix well, and add the meat (Bowl
  #4). Reduce until semi-thick while stirring (or it will stick) Let it cool
  for a few moments. Mix equal amounts of rice and sauce in a bowl, about 3
  Tbsp for each item to be stuffed. Stuff the tomatoes and peppers carefully,
  trying to fill all gaps. Arrange on pan that fits them, and bake at 350
  degrees for about a half hour. Be careful to fill them completely, but not
  overfill, the idea being that they should not leak any of the sauce. When
  done, the skins will be wrinkled and lighter in color, but still have some
  crunch. Serve with extra unused sauce as a toping. The baked sauce will be
  far less spicy than the origional sauce. Sauce can also be served over
  rice.

  slowly, a little at a time, while tossing mixture to moisten thoroughly.
  Take care to add only enough liquid to moisten or stuffing will become
  sodden. To test stuffing in order to see if seasonings are correct, melt a
  little butter in small skillet. Add rounded tablespoon of stuffing to
  skillet and stir until lightly golden. If it needs a more lively flavor,
  add more sage, onions or celery. Makes Enough for 16-Pound Turkey

      Title: TURKEY BREAST PIE FOR PASSOVER
 Categories: Italian, Poultry, Holiday
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Matzot; regular*
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth;cold
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey breast -OR:
  1 1/2 lb Turkey breast; cubed*
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 ts -salt
    1/4 ts -freshly ground black pepper
      1 ds Nutmeg
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Sage; dried -OR:
      2    -large fresh sage leaves
      1    Garlic clove;large
    1/2 ts Rosemary;dried, wrapped in
           -cheesecloth
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
      2    Eggs;slightly beaten
           Matza meal*
      3    Egg yolks
 
  *Matzots and mastza meal may be bought in Jewish grocery stores and many
  supermarkets *The recipe calls for cubes of turkey breast to be ground;
  however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be acceptable
  
  Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them. In a
  large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute, stirring frequently
  until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried sage is used, enclose it
  in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you using ground turkey, add garlic
  and bay leaf to this cheesecloth bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool.
  Remove and discard bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to
  saucepan with oil and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid from
  the matzot, but do not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the saucepan and
  turn heat off. If using cubed turkey breast, grind it now and return to the
  saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly. Oil a 9 inch cake pan and
  sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture into it; level it with a
  spatula. With a small ladle, make three depressions near the centre and
  place 1 egg yolk in each depression. Bake in 375F oven for 1/2 hour.

  1 1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Stock
           ----- Gravey For "Turkey"
      2 ts Margarine
  2 1/2 tb Flour
      1 c  Reserved gluten stock
           -from "turkey" recipe
      1 tb White wine
           Several dashes soy sauce
      1 tb Light Yeast Flovoring
           -see recipe, optional
 
  The yuba must be soaked and reconstituted to a soft, pliable texture before
  using.  It is best to put individual sheets between wet towels until they
  turn soft and white in color.  They are then ready to use. Using either
  wheat flour or vital wheat gluten flour, make gluten according to the
  recipe.  Roll it out into a rectangle approximately 15 inches long and 8 to
  10 inches wide.  Sprinkle with 1/3 cup yeast flavoring (unless you've added
  it in with your vital wheat gluten).  Roll it up lengthwise. Spread out the
  cheesecloth and place the glutten roll in the middle. Wrap the sides of the
  cloth around the glutten roll first, then tie the ends together. It should
  be wrapped fairly loosely so that the gluten can expand a little while
  cooking but not so loose that it expands too much and becomes too soft and
  spongy in texture. Place the roll in a large pot. Pour over it the gallon
  of water and the remaining 2/3 cup yeast flavoring. Cover bring to a boil,
  turn down the heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. This process can be done up
  to two days before serving. Prepare the stuffing of your choice. Remove the
  gluten roll from the stock, saving the stock for gravy. Untie and remove
  the cheesecloth. Unroll the "turkey" and fill it with the stuffing, or
  mound the stuffing on a large greased baking sheet and place the gluten
  around it.  Place the stuffed gluten on a large greased baking sheet.
  Reconstitute the yuba as mentioned before, by soaking for 5 minutes in
  water in a flat, shallow dish or between layors of wet towels.  It will
  turn white and be pliable but will still be fragile.  Cover the "turkey"
  with two to three layers of yuba.  Melt the margarine and brush the entire
  "turkey" with some of it.  Pour the wine into the remaining margarine: this
  will be used for basting while baking.  If desired, 2 tablespoons of the
  yeast flavoring can be added to the margarine-wine mixture to give it an
  even more authentic flavor.

      Title: SYD'S TURKEY GRAVY
 Categories: Poultry, Sauces
      Yield: 16 servings
 
           Turkey giblets
           Water, cold
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  Turkey drippings
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Assuming you are going to roast a turkey in the oven, it will be
  in a roasting pan of some kind.  I am also assuming this turkey
  had giblets (you know, liver, heart, gizzard and neck). While
  the turkey is roasting, put the giblets in a pretty large pot
  with lots of water and a little salt.  Bring them to a boil and
  let 'em simmer.  No length of time - just till they are done.
  
  After you remove the turkey from the roaster, there should be
  lots of juices in there that have accumulated during roasting.
   I pour them out into something and skim the fat off (or use one
  of those fat skimming cups or brushes).  Then, put the de-fatted
  drippings back into the pan.  Add some of the liquid from
  cooking the giblets if needed to make 2 c.  Whisk
  flour into it, and simmer while it thickens.
  
  Scrape up all of the "goodies" from the bottom of the pan to
  make the gravy extra-flavorful. If it gets too thick, you can
  add more liquid. If it isn't thick enough, add more flour and
  continue to whisk it, to keep out most of the lumps. You can
  chop up the giblets, finely and add them to the gravy as it is
  almost done - just to heat them through.
  
  If you have to add something because the color is not what you
  would like, a dash of Kitchen Bouquet will do it - not much.

  celery and onion. (Skin and drippings may be included, if desired.) Simmer,
  covered about 4 hours. Strain, reserving stock. Let bones cool, pick out
  any meat and add to the stock.
  
  SOUP: In stockpot or saucepan, bring stock to boil; add noodles and simmer
  for 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, green onions, zucchini, basil and thyme.
  Simmer for 10 minutes.  Stir in hot pepper sauce, season with salt and
  pepper to taste.  Makes about 4 1/2 cups.

      Title: LATTICE-TOPPED TURKEY PIE
 Categories: Poultry, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Turkey; cooked, chopped
     10 oz Peas
      4 oz Cheese, cheddar, shredded
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Onions, chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper, black
      1 c  Mayonnaise
      1 cn Crescent dinner rolls
      2 ts Seeds, sesame
 
  Preheat oven to 350.  Combine first 8 ingredients; mix well. Spoon into a
  12"x8"x2" baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick coating. Separate
  crescent dough into rectangles; press perforations to seal. Cut into 4 long
  strips and 4 short strips. Arrange strips in lattice design across top of
  your casserole. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake 35 minutes. Garnish with
  radish slices and fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.
  
  Sylvia's comments: This was a big hit at our house -- only a little strip
  was left along one edge of the casserole! I used nonfat mayonnaise, and bet
  that nonfat yogurt would work just as well to cut down on fat. I was out of
  peas, so used corn.  And I used leftover chicken instead of turkey. Save
  this one for a neat way to use up your leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

      2 c  Turkey stock
           Turkey giblets,cooked,choped
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  1. Preheat oven to 425'F.~ 2. Cut butter into very thin slices; place in
  freezer to harden while you prepare bird.~ 3. Wash turkey inside and out.
  Remove and reserve neck, giblets and wing tips. Pat dry with paper
  toweling. Starting at the breast, separate the skin from the meat by
  working your fingers between them. Slice your hand under skin as far as you
  can go and gently free the skin on both sides of the breast. Loosen it
  around the upper part of the legs, stopping about halfway down the legs.
  Insert slices of the cold butter, first under the leg skin, then under the
  breast skin. Reshape the loosened skin on the bird by patting it gently
  back in place. It will sag a bit but don't let that upset you; it will cook
  back in place. Wrap bird loosely in waxed paper and refrigerate while
  preparing stuffing.~ 4. Fill cavity of turkey loosely with stuffing. (Place
  any remaining stuffing in a shallow baking dish and place in oven about 30
  minutes before bird is roasted. Bake until firm and lightly browned.)
  Fasten neck skin of turkey to body with skewer. Push legs under band of
  skin at tail or tie to tail. Place slices of salt pork over breast and
  fasten with wooden picks. Place turkey on its side on rack in shallow open
  roasting pan.~ 5. Cook for 15 minutes, then turn bird on other side and
  roast for 15 minutes longer.~ 6. Lower temperature to 325'F. and continue
  to roast turkey, turning the bird from side to side and basting often with
  the drippings from pan, for about 3-1/2 to 4 hours, or until juices run
  yellow - no longer pink - when thigh is pierced with a fork. Roast turkey
  breast side up for the last 15 minutes of cooking time. (Remove and discard
  salt pork when crisp and most of fat has been rendered. If fat in pan bgins
  to burn, add a few tablespoons of water.) Transfer turkey to serving
  platter and let rest 30 minutes before carving. Reserve all drippings in
  pan for gravy.~ ~ *** CORN BREAD STUFFING ***~ 1. Prepare corn bread,
  following label directions, or use your own favorite recipe. Cool. Crumble
  enough to make 7 cups and transfer to a large mixing bowl.~ 2. Saute celery

      Title: 400-CLOVE GARLIC TURKEY FROM THE STINKING ROSE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Turkey
      4 oz Butter
      2 oz Olive oil
      1 c  Sage, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed
           Salt
           Pepper
      2 lb Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 c  Wine, white
      2 c  Stock, chicken
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Turkey stock may be substituted for chicken stock, if available.
  
  Clean and wash the turkey and pat dry with a paper towel. Loosen the skin
  of the breast and rub the turkey under the skin with the sage and chopped
  garlic. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and pepper and remaining
  sage. Place turkey in a large roasting pan, preferably on a rack. Roast the
  turkey at 350 degrees, basting every twenty minutes with the melted butter
  and olive oil combined.
  
  An hour and half before the turkey will be finished, add the 400 garlic
  cloves to the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to baste the turkey and
  at the same time stir the cloves at the bottom of the pan. Then the turkey
  is done, remove it from the pan. Drain the drippings into a small sauce
  pan, reserving the garlic in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on a
  burner over medium-high heat. Add white wine and stock. Bring to a boil,
  stirring with a wisk to mash the roasted garlic cloves.
  
  Place the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat and with a whip add
  the flour to form a roux. Add the roux to the garlic gravy a little at a
  time until it reaches the desired thickness. Carve the turkey and serve
  with the 400-clove garlic gravy, accompnied by garlic mashed potatoes.
  
  This popular North Beach restaurant claims that it "seasons its garlic with
  food."  You'll see what they mean when you look at the list of ingredients.

      Title: STUFFING BALLS
 Categories: Dressings, Holiday
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      1 x  Turkey giblets
      8 tb Butter
      4    Celery tops
     20 sl Bread
     20 sl Bread, salt rising
     16 oz Pepperidge Farm stuffing
      2 c  Chicken stock
      2    Onions, chopped
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  Boil giblets, butter, and celery tops until done. Toast breads, then break
  toast into small pieces.  Add Pepperidge Farm stuffing to toast. Cook
  chopped onions in stock. When tender, add to bread mix. If dressing is too
  dry, add chicken stock for additional moisture. Preheat oven to 350. Form
  into serving-size balls and place in buttered baking dish. Spoon additional
  broth over balls. Bake 1 hour or until brown.
  
  This dressing is moist and is very easy to serve.  If I have too much for
  Thanksgiving I freeze uncooked balls and use them at Christmas which helps
  speed up dinner that busy day. I hope that your kids will like this recipe;
  mine always liked the balls.
  
  The one secret to my dressing is Salt Rising bread. My Grandmother always
  used it with other bread (we had to keep it a secret because my father
  hated salt rising even though you can not tell is is in there). I also have
  a hard time making just a little dressing and it always looks like I'm
  fixing for an army.

 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Main dish, Mexican, Poultry, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato; Peeled & Seeded,1 Md
      1 tb Vegetable Oil
      2 ts Chili Powder
      1 ts Instant Chicken Bouillon
      1 c  Cooked Chicken Or Turkey; *
      8    Eggs; Large
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
      4 tb Margarine Or Butter
 
  *    The chicken or turkey should be chopped into small chunks.
  ~--------------------------------------------------------------------- ~--
  In a blender container, combine the 1/4 cup of water, tomato, oil, chili
  powder, and chicken bouillon granules.  Blend until very smooth. Transfer
  to a small saucepan.  Cook, stirring constantly, until thick, about 7
  minutes.  Stir in the chicken or turkey.  Season with a little salt and
  pepper.  Keep warm.  With a fork, beat the eggs with the second 1/4 cup of
  water, the salt and pepper, until well blended but not frothy. In an 8-inch
  omelet pan heat 1 Tbls of the butter until it sizzles and browns slightly.
  Tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides. Pour about 1/2 cup of the egg
  mixture, leaving the heat on medium-high. As the egg sets, lift the edges
  to allow the uncooked portion on top to run under the cooked portion.
  Continue until all of the egg is cooked.  Spoon about 1/4 cup of the
  chicken mixture down the center of the omelet.  Fold the sides of the
  omelet up over the chicken mixture.  Tilt the omelet pan to roll the omelet
  over and out onto a hot plate.  Repeat with the remaining butter, egg
  mixture and chicken filling, three more times and serve hot.

      4 md Yellow onions, chopped
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      3    Ribs celery, sliced
      1 sm Green pepper, chopped
      1    28-oz can crushed tomatoes
    1/2 c  Water
      4 tb Chili powder
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Whole cumin seed
 
  Top with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream OR chopped ripe
  avocado
  
  1.  Soak the beans overnight in water to cover generously.  Drain and
  rinse briefly.
  
  2.  Heat the oil in a large, heavy bottom pot over medium high heat.
  When hot, brown the turkey breast well on all sides.  Remove and set
  aside.
  
  3.  Add the onions, garlic, celery, and green pepper.  Saute, stirring
  frequently, until the vegetables are soft, 5-7 minutes.
  
  4.  Add the beans, tomatoes, water, chili powder, cayenne, and the
  turkey breast.  Heat until the pot starts bubbling, then reduce heat to
  a slow simmer, partially cover, and simmer for 1 1/2 hour.  Stir
  occasionally, watching carefully that the bottom does not start to
  stick.
  
  5.  Remove the turkey breast, remove the bone, and coarsely shred the
  meat with two forks (hold the meat with one fork, tear with the grain
  with the other.) Return the meat to the pot.
  
  6.  Heat a heavy bottom skillet over low heat.  Add the whole cumin seed
  and toast 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until lightly brown
  and aromatic.  Remove from heat.  Coarsely crush the cumin in a mortar
  and pestle or with a rolling pin.  Add to the pot.
  
  7.  Cook an additional one hour, or until the beans are tender.
  
  8.  For the traditional approach, top with the cheese and sour cream;
  for the modern/healthy approach, top with the avocado.

      Title: TURKEY AND ROCKET SALAD WITH MACADAMIAS
 Categories: Salads, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Bunch of rocket, discarding
           The coarse stem ends
      1 sm Soft lettuce
    250 g  Macadamia nuts
      2 cl Garlic, chopped
           Salt & pepper to taste
    100 ml Macadamia oil
     50 ml White wine vinegar
      1 lb Turkey, sliced
           Chives
 
      Turkey meat, which tends to be dry, benefits particularly from this
  macadamia dressing, but any roast poultry meat you have left over can be
  used instead. Another soft lettuce can stand in for the rocket (arugula) if
  you simply can't obtain the latter, but it won't provide the delicate,
  savoury flavour. Macadamia oil can now be obtained in some supermarkets.
      Arrange the leaves on four plates.
  
      Heat 250 g macadamia nuts in an ungreased container in the oven until
  they smell appetizing, then set half aside and tip the other half into the
  bowl of a food processor. Add: 2 garlic cloves, roughly chopped. With salt
  and pepper process to a paste.
   With the food processor.running, slowly add 100 ml macadamia oil, then 50
  ml white wine vinegar.
  
      Slice or shred enough turkey for four people and gently loss it in the
  macadamia salad.
  
      Arrange the dressed turkey on the prepared plates, drizzle left-over
  dressing over the salad leaves, Sprinkle with reserved macadamia nuts,
  roughly chopped, and finely chopped chives. Serve.

     A few extra chillies would give this salad a lot more punch.

           Carving*
           Any left over gravy
           Any left over vegetables
      2 lg Carrots, sliced
      2    Stalks celery (& tops),
           Chopped
      1 cn (12 oz) no salt green
           Beans, drained
      2 qt Boiling water
           Any peels, root ends and
           Leafy tops left over from -
           Onions, celery, potatoes,
           Carrots
           Several bruised garlic
           Cloves
     12 oz Wide egg noodles

           Drained
      1 lg White onion, chopped
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
    Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a
  chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over peelings &
  parings into a stock pot and fill with water.  Add garlic cloves.  Fill the
  stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let
  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
  large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
  and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
  turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
  left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
  the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
  over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
  per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
  the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
  Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
  heat noodles and serve.
  
  Makes a bunch!

      Title: CHILI WITH BEANS
 Categories: Mexican, Beef, Meats, Chili, Beans
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 pk Pinto beans
      2 lb Chili meat OR
      4 lb Lean beef sirloin, chopped
           In 1/2 inch cubes
      1 lb Low-fat turkey sausage
      1 c  Onions, chopped
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Red cayenne pepper
      2 cn Tomato sauce
      3 tb New Mexico (or other hot)
           Chili powder
      1 ts Dried oregano
      2 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Louisiana (or Tobasco) Hot
           Sauce
      1 cn Jalapenos, chopped
    1/2 tb Salt
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Michael Gallagher Bob, here is my variation of
  a chili recipe with beans in it. If the people here don't like beans with
  their chili, I'll give a substitution. DON'T change anything, for this is
  the way you should make authentic Texas chili--not the cheap imitation
  stuff.
  
  Wash beans in colander and soak overnight. Wash again next day, and place
  in large chili pot. Cover with water about 1/2 to 3/4 inch over beans;
  simmer, covered, for about 2-1/2 hours or until done.
  
  If substituting beans with the lean beef sirloin, brown the meat 1 pound at
  a time, preferably in a non-stick skillet without any oil. Place the meat
  in large chili pot. You will also need 1 more 12 ounce can of tomato sauce
  and 1 to 2 10 ounce cans of fat-skimmed beef stock. You will add the extra
  can of tomato sauce and the can of beef stock in the next paragraph of
  directions.
  
  Brown meat and place in large saucepan. Add all of the other ingredients
  and spices. Mix well. Simmer, covered, for 1 hour. When beans are done, add
  contents of saucepan to chili pot and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes. Makes 15
  to 20 servings, 225 calories each (205 with out the oil). Salt and pepper
  to taste.

  In Saucepan, melt butter, add flour.  Stir in broth and milk; cook until
  thickened, stirring frequently.  Add remaining ingredients.
  
  Fill Stuff-a-roni.
  
  Cover bottom of 2 quart baking dish with 1 cup cheese sauce.  Arrange
  filled stuff-a-roni in single layer in baking dish.  Cover with remaining
  sauce.
  
  Cover dish with foil and bake at 375-degrees F., for one hour; or cover
  dish with waxed paper and microwave 30 minutes turning once.
  
  Note: I usually make this dish after Thanksgiving.  I freeze left over
  turkey and gravy, and then later, when turkey seems like a treat again, I
  make the Stuff-a-roni.  I do not use the wine; in it's place I use turkey
  gravy, and when it calls for broth, I also use a fair portion of turkey
  gravy.

 Categories: Poultry, Microwave
      Yield: 10 servings
 
           -----INGREDIENTS-----
      1    12-14 defrosted turkey
      1    Large Oven Roasting Bag
           - (turkey size)
      1    Recipe Turkey Basting Agent
           (see index)
 
  TURKEY COOKED IN THE MICROWAVE REMAINS TASTY LONGER THEN OVEN
  
  First stuff the turkey with your favorite stuffing mix. Then paint the
  turkey with the prepared turkey basting agent (see index). Gently place the
  stuffed and painted bird in the flour dusted roasting bag and place into a
  glass microwave roasting pan.  Enter the weight of the turkey on your
  microwave computer.  For example, a 12 lb, 8 oz bird will cook in the
  microwave oven 115-121 minutes at 70% power. Standing time will be 57-60
  minutes. Dividing the time into fourths, the bird will cook at 70% power
  for about 29 minutes on its breast side; turn the dish and cook another 29
  minutes.  Now carefully turn the bird upside down (there will be a lot of
  juices in the bag, so be extra careful). With the bird breast side up, cook
  another 29 minutes at 70% power.

  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream.  Let it
  simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
  Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
  go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
  this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
  salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
  cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
  fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
  and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
  pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
  the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
  as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
  tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
  each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
  adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
  decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients.  Press down
  lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
  cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
  refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
  be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
  serving.

      2 oz Tablet Mexican drinking
           -chocolate
           Sea salt to taste
 
  Oaxacan Black Mole Serves 10 to 12
  
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste.  Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and
  continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35 minutes.
  Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and remove
  seeds and veins, reserving the seeds.  Toast the chilies for about 50
  seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them longer, until
  they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the chilies in cold water,
  cover with hot water, and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Put the
  reserved chile seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast over fairly
  high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that they brown evenly.
  Then raise the heat and char until black.  Cover with cold water and set
  aside to soak for about 5 minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed until a
  deep golden color - a few seconds.  Strain, putting the fat back into the
  pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate, one by
  one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each addition and
  adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to cook
  the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat, stirring and
  scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in which
  they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth. When you
  have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried ingredients together
  with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes longer. Add about 4 cups of the
  chicken broth and continue cooking for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms
  on the top if you are going to make tamales or mole. It is added to color
  and flavor the masa.)  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just
  coat the back of a wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste;
  cook for 10 minutes longer.

      Title: MOLE POBLANO PICANTE
 Categories: Poultry, Soups/stews, Mexican, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8    Mulato chiles
      4    Ancho chiles
      4    Pasilla chiles
      8 lb Turkey, in pieces
      4 tb Lard
      4 tb Sesame seeds
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      1    Tortilla, cut up
      1 c  Blanched almonds
    1/8 ts Ground gloves
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seed
    1/4 ts Anise
    1/2 c  Raisins
      3    Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      4    Canned chipotle chiles
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Prepare the mulato, ancho, and pasilla chiles by washing in cold water;
  removing veins, stems, and seeds; and tearing them roughly into pieces.
  Place the pieces in a bowl and soak in hot water (about 1 cup to 6 chiles)
  for about an hour. Blend the chiles with the soaking water in a blender,
  but do not over blend. The texture should remain coarse.
  
  Place the turkey pieces in a flameproof casserole with a lid, and poach,
  covered, in salted water to barely cover for 1 hour. Drain, reserving the
  stock. Dry the turkey pieces thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the lard in
  a skillet, and brown the turkey pieces, a few at a time. Arrange the turkey
  pieces in the casserole and keep warm. Combine 2 tbs of the sesame seeds,
  the onion, garlic, tortilla, almonds, cloves, cinnamon, coriander seed,
  anise, raisins, tomatoes, prepared chiles, and chipotle chiles, and reduce,
  bit by bit, to a coarse puree in the electric blender.
  
  Heat the remaining lard in a skillet, adding, if necessary, a little more
  lard to bring it up to 3 TBS. Cook the puree, stirring constantly, for
  about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the turkey stock, chocolate, salt and pepper
  to taste, and the sugar, and cook, over very low heat, until the chocolate
  has melted. Pour the sauce over the turkey; cover; and cook over the lowest
  possible heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The sauce should be rather
  thicker than the consistency of heavy cream. If it seems too thin, thin
  with turkey stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before
  serving.
  
  NOTE: Chipotle chile and its close relative morita chile have the most
  exotic flavor of any of the Mexican chiles. They are also exceedingly
  picante and can really lift your head off. If you do not care for hot food,
  experiment with the chipotle, for even in a small quantity its flavor will
  survive. Begin with a half chile, tasting and adding more to your mole with
  caution until you find the amount that suits your taste.

      4 tb Lard
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/2 c  Peanuts
      1    Tortilla, coarsely chopped
      4 tb Sesame seeds
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Cinnamon

      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
  Picante. Place the turkey and pork in a large kettle with enough salted
  water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Drain,
  reserving the stock. Dry the turkey and pork pieces thoroughly with paper
  towels. Heat the lard in a large, heavy skillet. Brown the turkey and pork
  pieces, a few at a time; then transfer to a flameproof casserole. In the
  electric blender, blend the almonds, peanuts, tortilla, 2 tbs of the sesame
  seeds, cloves, cinnamon, anise, tomatoes, and the prepared chiles, and
  reduce to a coarse puree.
  
  Heat the lard remaining in the skillet, adding a little more if necessary,
  and cook the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 2 cups of the
  reserved stock, the chocolate, salt and pepper to taste, and sugar. Stir
  until chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce over the turkey and pork in the
  casserole; cover; and cook over very low heat for about 1 hour, taking care
  not to let it burn. Sauce should be the consistency of heavy cream, so, if
  necessary, thin with more stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just
  before serving.

      Title: CHEESE FONDUE, AMERICAN STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           ****FONDUE****
      4 cn Campbell's Cheddar cheese
           Soup, undiluted
      1 lb Cheddar cheese sharp, grated
      5 x  Cloves fresh garlic
           Or 1tbsp. garlic powder
      2 tb Kirsch or cherry brandy
           ****DIPPERS****
           FRENCH BREAD
           Ham
           Shrimp
           Smokie links
           Cocktail wieners
           ****DIPPERS****
           Hot dogs
           Smoked sausage
           Turkey, chicken breast
           Turkey ham
           Broccoli
           Cauliflower
           Carrots
           Mushrooms
           Brussel sprouts
           Cherry tomatoes
           Celery stalk
           Radishes
 
  Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
  grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
  freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
  small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
  while stirring.
  FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your area, if not,
  any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at 350 degrees
  for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces. It's best
  when crusty.
  MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized pieces any or all of
  these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail wieners, smoked sausage,
  turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham, hot dogs.
  VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or else the
  pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the pot.... or
  raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,
  mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk, radishes.
  VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's Nacho cheese
  dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for regular
  cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalape¤o peppers to
  the cheese mixture for extra zest.
  SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall
  day for lunch, or a freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts
  during a gentle spring rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne
  or wine. Best mood is created if candles are lit and a fire is
  blazing in the fireplace.
  Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
  heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
  fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
  sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
  so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
  years). Enjoy!

      Yield: 15 units
 
      3 lb Lean beef*
  1 1/2 lb Calf meat
    1/2 lb Chicken
    1/2 lb Turkey
    1/2 lb Rabbit
  1 1/2 lb Day old wheat bread
    1/4 lb Ham (optional)
      4    Garlic cloves
      4 ts Olive oil
      2 oz Pork drippings**
           Paprika, salt and
           -piripiri to taste
     10    Feet tripe casing
 
  *    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons.
  **   Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet.
  You may change the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be
  all chicken, etc., provided the total amount remains the same.
  You can use partridge, quail, duck, and so on...
  Boil the meats together long enough to make the bones separate from
  the meat by themselves. Reserve the resulting broth and set meats
  aside.
  In a large bowl place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth.
  Cover with a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with
  an wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and a
  little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix thoroughly.
  When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and the pork
  drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie each
  'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling concentrated in
  the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty. Smoke for 2 or 3
  hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together before selling or using
  ~ the 'alheira' should be U shaped.
  A typical way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil,
  and presenting them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add
  broccoli as a side dish.

      2 tb Miso
      2 tb Orange juice
      1 ts Mustard of choice
      1 lb Tofu for the "drumsticks"
 
  :       -optional
  
  Mash tofu or mix well with hands.  Be sure that all of the lumps are out.
  Line a 12" colander with wet cheesecloth over lapping the sides. Add the
  mashed tofu to the cloth covered colander, press down and cover with the
  overlapping sides.  Place the whole thing in a large bowl. Cover the
  cheesecloth with a plate that fits inside the colander and place a 5 pound
  weight on the plate. Refrigerate and let sit for 2 to 3 hours.
  
  When time is up, start the stuffing.  Saute' the onions, celery and
  mushrooms in the 2 tablesoons sesame oil.  When soft, add the garlic and
  all the rest of the stuffing ingredients, except stuffing, mixing well.
  Stir and cook for 5 minutes.  Add herb stuffing and mix well.
  
  Remove tofu from fridge and take off weight, plate and top of cheesecloth.
  Hollow out tofu to within 1 inch of the sides and bottom, placing the tofu
  in a bowl.  Place the stuffing inside the shell and pack in firmly. Cover
  with the remaining tofu and pat down firmly. Turn stuffed tofu onto a
  greased baking sheet, flat side down. Gently press on sides of "turkey" to
  achieve a more oval shape. If desired at this point, you may mold
  "drumsticks" out of one pound of tofu, and place on each side of the
  "turkey".
  
  Mix up the basting mixture and baste tofu "turkey" with half of it. Cover
  the "turkey" with foil, and bake at 400 degrees for about 1 hour.
  
  Remove foil, baste with all the remaining mixture except a few tablespoons
  and return to oven for 1 hour more, or until the "turkey" is golden. Remove
  from oven and use rest of basting mix.  Using at least 2 large spatulars,
  move to a large plate.  Serve with the gravy of your choice, if you wish,
  and cranberry sauce. Tastes good leftover (if there is any!) in sandwiches
  or plain.

      Title: PORRO'S ONE POT OLYMPIC POULTRY
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Easy
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Ingredients:
           Chicken or Turkey parts to
           -match servings desired.
      1 qt Chicken Broth or Chicken
           -Soup
      1 ts Cilantro
      1 ts Ground Correander Seed (only
           -if you don't use Cilantro!)
      1 tb Oregano
    1/4 sm Onion chopped
      1    Clove garlic minced
    1/4 c  Cooking wine (bitter orange
           -or other fruit is best)
      1 ts Ground White pepper
      1 tb Crushed Red pepper (subst.
           -Cayenne)
      1 ts Sweet Basil (optional, I
           -like it)
    1/4    Lemon with rind on
      1 c  Rice uncooked (I don't use
           -pre-cooked type, but either
           -works)
 
  Choose your large cast iron pot (my usual) or in my case now with no
  stove, a West Bend electric fry pan.
  
  Set to simmer and add chicken soup. (I use egg drop by the way, but
  that's another step) While broth is warming, wash chicken as you
  usually do. Add all seasonings except the peppers. Squeeze the lemon
  for it's juice and toss it in without the seeds. When you can see
  that the broth is just starting to boil every time the light goes
  out, you know it's just right, below boiling temp. You don't want
  this to boil unless you are in a hurry, want to do lots of pot
  watching or you like tough chicken. No need to add salt or sugar
  since there is usually more than enough already in the soup. The
  chicken should not be covered in liquid, this is not intended to be
  soup when you get done.
  
  When you have the temp. fine tuned to true simmer, place the poultry
  parts in the broth, meaty side up as possible. Sprinkle on the white
  and red pepper, cover the pot and ignore it for as long as you wish
  the longer the better, I usually shoot for at least 4 hours. Before
  serving at least 20 min. before you want to eat, flip the meat and
  add the rice. Check to make sure there is enough water, bring up to
  original level if necessary. This should turn out fairly thick, and
  not soup because the rice absorbs most or all of the liquid. Stir it
  in well and cover again. When the rice is done it's finished. Spoon
  out rice onto plates and place poultry on the side of it. I like to
  serve this with a large tossed salad, using Olive Oil, 1 T lemon
  juice, 2T Oregano, and 1 clove garlic, or garlic powder. (See Porro's
  Italian Salad for details)
  
  I use Cajun seasoning, but wanted this to have a more general appeal,
  if you like it hotter, go for it. Sort of a Cajun/Italian recipe.
  Some other notes and options. 2 t of parsley won't hurt. Also
  optional: (it's not cast in stone, add what you like) fresh sliced
  mushrooms. I confess, I never measure any of the above, it's all done
  by taste, do the same please! Anytime you use fresh spices it will
  taste better.
  
  Why I make and eat this. 1) For sporting events, one never knows for
  certain when it will be time to eat. Also if you have company that
  shows up late on a regular basis, this type of cooking and be on hold
  for extended periods of time, without harm. 2) No stove. 3) The slow
  cooking will make even a laying hen edible. 4) For a whomped up one
  pot, one plate dinner it actually has some taste to it.  5) Sometimes
  I want something that is easy and doesn't need tending, this is it.
  Probably best for family cooking rather than guests. 6) When I was
  cooking for three teens I never knew if any two would every be at
  home for dinner at the same time. It keeps well for hours after
  adding the rice.

      2    Onions chopped
      8 ct Pods, punctured
      3    2-inch cinnamon sticks
     10    To 15 peppercorns
      8    Cloves
  3 1/2 qt Water
      1 c  Chick-peas soaked
      4    Strips orange rind
    1/2 ts Saffron
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Nutmeg
      2 tb Honey
      1 cc Fresh ginger, sliced
      6    Sprigs parsley
     10    To 15 sprigs cilantro
    1/2 lb Carrots, scraped, cut in
           -chunks
  1 1/2    Pumpkin, peeled, cut in
           -chunks
      2    Sweet red peppers, seeded,
           -quartered
           Chopped cilantro for garnish
 
  If using the dried chiles, soak them in a cup of hot water for 1
  hour, then drain.  Pound or mince the chiles, garlic and salt into a
  paste. Mix all or some of this paste, according to the degree of
  hotness desired, with the broth, and serve hot, garnished with the
  cilantro.
  
  Aromatic Broth:
  
  Put the chicken parts, turkey neck and giblets, butter, onions,
  cardamom, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns and cloves into a heavy pan.
  Cover and cook over medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Before the mixture begins to brown, add the remaining ingredients
  (except chopped cilantro).  Cover and simmer for 1 hour, skimming off
  as much fat as possible.  Raise the heat to medium and let the broth
  cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.  The broth should reduce to about 7 cups
  during this time. Season with salt and remove from heat.
  
  Remove the pieces of chicken and discard.  Strain the broth through a
  large sieve set over a large bowl, pressing against the vegetables.
  Set aside 3 cups broth to make the harissa sauce.  Serve the
  remainder, piping hot, garnished with cilantro.

      1    Smoked turkey wing
      1 md Yellow onion, diced
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      2 lb Fresh green beans
     12    To 16 small red creamer
           -potatoes
      1 qt Water
           Salt, if needed
           Pepper, to taste
 
  Chef Regina Charboneau makes these for her 2-year-old son, Jean-Luc.
  Place a heavy sauce pot over medium heat and let preheat for about 3
  minutes; add turkey wing, stir and turn until it begins to release
  some of its oil. (If pan is hot enough, you should not have a problem
  with sticking.) Add diced onion and stir to brown for about 3
  minutes, adding garlic at end.
  
  Add green beans, potatoes and water (enough to just cover the
  vegetables) then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender,
  which may take 35 to 45 minutes, depending on size of potatoes.
  Season with pepper and salt to taste (the turkey wing usually adds
  enough salt).
  
  Serves 6.

 Categories: Cajun, Gumbo, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Smoked turkey, carcus
           -including any skin
     10 c  Water (approximately)
      1    Onion, sliced
      1    Stalk celery, sliced
      3    Sprigs parsley
      1    Sprig fresh thyme, or 1/4
           -teaspoon dried thyme
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Finely diced onion
    1/2 c  Finely diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced green or red
           -bell pepper
      1 ts Chile powder (New Mexico,
           -California or ancho)
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
    1/4 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
    1/8 ts Cayenne (optional)
      2 lb Assorted, shellfish *
      2 c  Cooked long-grain rice
 
  * small raw shrimp, peeled and deveined; cooked crab meat; small
  shucked oysters
  
  Place the carcass in a stock pot, breaking it up, if necessary, to
  make it fit.  Add water to cover.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a
  simmer, and skim off any foam that comes to the surface.
  
  Add the sliced onion, celery, parsley, thyme sprig and bay leaf;
  simmer, uncovered, skimming occasionally, for 2 to 4 hours.  (The
  longer you cook it, the richer the stock will be.)   Do not let the
  stock boil or it will turn cloudy.
  
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast iron), over
  medium heat.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring and scraping the
  entire bottom of the pan at least every 10 seconds, until the
  resulting roux cooks to a deep mahogany color, 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Adjust the heat to prevent scorching, which can give a bitter taste.
  Turn off the heat and continue stirring a minute or two until the
  mixture no longer gets darker on the bottom.
  
  Carefully stir in the diced vegetables tables; don't let the roux
  splatter it can cause nasty burns.  Stir to coat the vegetables
  evenly with roux; stir in the chile powder, salt, pepper, herbs and
  cayenne; set aside. (The roux may be prepared to this point while the
  stock cooks.) Strain the stock, let it stand until the fat rises to
  the top, and skim off the fat.
  
  Bring 8 cups of the stock to a boil in a large pot, stir in the roux
  vegetable mixture and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15
  minutes.
  
  Add the shrimp, crab and/or oysters and simmer just until done, about
  5 minutes.  Taste for seasoning and correct if necessary. Serve in
  soup bowls over small scoops of rice.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

 Categories: Pasta, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      1    Celery stalk with leaves,
           -finely chopped
      1 md Carrot, finely chopped
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 cl Garlic, finely chopped
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey
      1 tb Dried oregano
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Half-and-half
      1 cn Plum tomatoes, crushed
           -slightly, with juices
           -(28 oz)
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 c  Defatted chicken broth
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
      1 lb Cooked linguine
      2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley,
           -for garnish
 
  To lighten a traditional Bolognese sauce, I substituted lean ground
  turkey for the more traditional ground beef. It's necessary to taste
  and adjust seasonings as you go along, since the flavor of turkey is
  not as strong as beef. I've added a generous amount of oregano and
  garlic for spice and sauteed the meat in extra-virgin olive oil for
  more flavor. Have patience with this sauce - the long, slow simmer is
  what makes it so delicious. Freshly grated Parmesan is perfect to
  serve alongside.
  
  1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
  celery, carrot, onion and garlic, then cook 8-10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  2. Raise heat to medium and add the ground turkey and oregano. Cook
  for about 8 minutes, stirring and breaking up the meat, until it
  begins to brown.
  
  3. Add the wine and simmer for about 10-12 minutes. Add the
  half-and-half and simmer until nearly reduced, about 6-8 minutes.
  
  4. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and broth. Bring to a gentle simmer
  and cook over medium-low heat, partially covered, for 1 hour,
  stirring a few times. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  5. Serve hot over just-cooked linguine and sprinkle with chopped
  parsley.

      2    Scallions (3" of green left
           -on), thinly sliced
      1    Red bell pepper, cored,

           Red pepper flakes, to taste
           Salt, to taste
           Black pepper, to taste
      4    Toasted hamburger buns
    1/4 c  Regular or reduced-calorie
           -mayonnaise-type dressing,
           -for garnish (opt)
      1 sm Ripe avacado, sliced, for
           -garnish (opt)
 
  It's necessary to highly season turkey because the meat itself tastes
  rather mild. Yet, once ground turkey is cooked up, it's delicious. To
  do a taste test on the mixture, make a little patty the size of a
  silver dollar and pan-fry it in a nonstick skillet. This way you can
  adjust your seasonings to taste. A mayonnaise-type dressing and
  avacado make perfect toppings.
  
  1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.
  
  2. Place the ground turkey in a bowl and mix well with the scallions,
  bell pepper, garlic, cilantro and spices. Season to taste with salt
  and pepper. Gently form into 4 patties.
  
  3. Grill patties over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 5-6 minutes
  per side.
  
  4. If desired, spread buns with mayonnaise-type dressing and top
  burgers with avacado slices. Serve immediately.
  
  Per serving (with avacado slices and reduced-calorie mayonnaise-type
  dressing): 346 calories, 13 grams fat, 62 milligrams cholesterol.

  Full Title : Roulade of Turkey with Foie Gras and Sauterne Sauce with
  Crispy Sweet Potatoes
  
  From Peter Kelly of Piermont, N.Y.
  
  Turkey roulade: Remove skin from turkey breast with sharp knife.
  Slice in 4 slices. Between sheets of plastic wrap, lightly pound
  turkey cutlets into paillardes (thin sheets). Season with Kosher salt
  and pepper.
  
  Divide foie gras (or chopped liver) in 4 parts and season with salt
  and pepper. Place a piece of foie gras in center of each turkey
  paillarde and roll turkey around foie gras.
  
  Carefully remove cabbage leaves, one at a time, first removing core.
  Boil cabbage leaves in a large pot just until wilted, about 3
  minutes, and refresh under cold running water. Dry thoroughly.
  
  For each roulade, lay out 2 or 3 cabbage leaves to form a square.
  Place turkey roulade in center and wrap with cabbage, forming a tight
  bundle. Refrigerate. Sautene sauce: Over high heat, reduce 1 cup of
  sauterne and 1 cup of chicken broth until sauce coats back of spoon
  (about 12 minutes). Sprinkle in 1/3 cup sun-dried cherries.
  
  Crispy sweet potatoes: Peel potato and poach in boiling water until
  just tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and slice very thin and then cut
  into julienne strips. In large saute pan, heat vegetable oil to hot,
  and fry potato strips for 1 minute, or until crisp. Pat dry with
  paper towels and toss with salt and pepper. To serve: Place roulades
  in center of bamboo steamer and steam exactly 15 minutes. Turkey will
  be cooked through and foie gras will be pink in center. Reheat
  sauterne sauce and spoon, with cherries, on 4 warmed plates. Place
  roulade in center of each plate and arrange crispy sweet potatoes

    1/2 ts Peppercorns, green
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, pink

           -- (carrots, turnips,
           -- string beans or
           -- zucchini)
 
  For the Chicken:
  ================
  
       To bone the chicken, producing two servings (or globi) per chicken,
  begin by cutting down along the breast bone, scraping along the bone to
  keep the meat intact.  Disjoint the wing and continue boning along the
  wishbone.
  
       Turn the chicken over and cut along the back bone, carving out the
  meat from the bone.  Disjoint the thigh and continue to remove the entire
  half of the chicken with the skin intact.
  
       Cut off the wing at the first joint leaving only the shoulder bone
  attached to the carcass.  Scrape the meat off of this remaining wing bone
  to remove the bone, leaving meat and skin attached to the half chicken.
  
       Remove the thigh bone, leaving meat attached to the chicken half. Cut
  around the knob end of the leg, releasing the skin and the tendons. Press
  the leg meat and skin firmly toward the thigh so that 1 1/2 to 2 inches of
  the leg bone is exposed.  Cut the knob off the end of the leg bone.
  
       Repeat the process with the second half of the chicken.
  
       Marinate the chicken meat for one hour in cognac, thyme and bay leaf.

      Title: VICKI'S TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey, Holiday, Vicki
      Yield: 1 turkey
 
           Turkey
           Butter, melted
           Kahlua
           Apricot preserves
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Rub cleaned turkey with unsalted shortening or butter.  Cover the bird with
  a piece of cheesecloth soaked in melted, unsalted butter. Reduce the heat
  to 350 and place turkey in oven.
  
  Make glaze of equal parts Kahlua and apricot preserves.  Sounds weird, but
  it is delicious.  Baste turkey with glaze right over the top of the
  cheesecloth.  (The taste actually permeates the meat.)
  
  Peel the cloth off before presentation (bird is a dark, rich brown) and
  serve w/ sauce.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  The basic technique is from "Joy of Cooking," although Rombauer says to
  put it on a rack.  The glaze is from the Kahlua company.
  
  *  The only time I used pop-up indicators is when I was given turkeys that
  had them.  I ignored the indicator --> used standard cooking chart for
  weight (should be on turkey).  You know how the turkey keeps cooking even
  when it's not in the oven?  Sure enough, after he had been out of oven long
  enough to serve, the indicator FINALLY popped up!

      Title: SHU MEI
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 1 batch
 
---------------------------------DUMPLINGS---------------------------------
      2 lb Turkey, ground
  1 1/2 ts Cornstarch (cornflour)
  1 1/2 ts Sherry, dry
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Ginger, grated
           -or finely chopped
      6    Green onions, chopped
      6    Garlic cloves,
           -crushed, minced
           -or pressed
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 pk Wonton wrappers
           Peanut oil

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Fish sauce (You may
           -want to dilute this
           -with water, depending
           -on its strength)
      1 c  Vinegar
      1 c  Sugar
      6    Garlic cloves, finely
           -minced or pressed
      1 tb Ginger, finely
           -minced or grated
      1 tb Red pepper, crushed
 
  Make the dipping sauce by mixing together all of its ingredients.  Store in
  the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.
  
  Stir together everything but the wrappers and the peanut oil.  Mix
  vigorously by hand until it begins to bind together. (About 1 minute or
  so.)
  
  Place about 1 1/2 - 2 T of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper.  Fold
  the sides up around the meat so that you have a little bag or cup.  Press
  the bottom flat so that the bag doesn't fall over.
  
  Oil racks of the steamer with peanut oil.  Place dumplings in racks.  Steam
  for 15 to 20 minutes in covered rack over boiling water.  Serve hot with
  dipping sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Steamed dumplings (meatballs) -- This recipe is an adaptation of the one
  in "The Frugal Gourmet" by Jeff Smith. The bigger the batch, the better.
  There are never leftovers. Yield: makes 35-40.
  
  *  These little gems would probably go just fine with a favorite hoisin or
  chili dipping sauce.
  
  *  The steamer racks I recommend are the Chinese bamboo ones.  You can
  stack them quite nicely (I find that three racks work well) and they sit at
  just the right height above the boiling water in a wok. The real advantage
  is that water will not condense on your food if you use a bamboo steamer.
  
  *  The dipping sauce is an adaption of one served at the Phoenix Vietnamese
  restaurant in Saint Paul Minnesota; it was originally served with egg
  rolls, but works splendidly with these dumplings.
  
  *  The original recipe calls for ground pork, but I find ground turkey
  preferable.  The flavor is lighter and the calories far fewer.  Pork is
  fine, though, and even hamburger could be used in a pinch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but tedious.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

           Vegetable oil

--------------------------------TURKEY BROTH--------------------------------
      1    Turkey neck
           -(skin removed)
           Giblets and gizzard
           -from 1 turkey
           Leaves from 4
           -celery stalks
      1    Celery stalk
      1 sm Onion, quartered
     12 c  Water

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
     12 oz Bread cubes (herbed)
      1 lg Yellow onion,
           -chopped fine
      3    Celery stalks,
           -chopped fine
      3 c  Rice, cooked (cooled
           -uncovered overnight
           -in a shallow dish)
    1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
      2 c  Pecans, roughly chopped
           Butter (or margarine)
           Salt
           Black pepper
           Rubbed sage
           Thyme
 
  MAKE CORNBREAD:  The night before, make the cornbread.  Preheat oven to 425
  degrees F.
  
  Thinly coat the bottom of a standard Pyrex pie plate, or 9-inch square
  baking pan, with vegetable oil. Put pan in oven while it is preheating and
  you are mixing the cornbread batter.
  
  In a mixing bowl, blend together the cornmeal, flour, salt and baking
  powder. Stir in the egg and about 3 T vegetable oil. Add milk and mix
  thoroughly by hand. The consistency should be a thick, but not "doughy,"
  liquid.  It may be necessary to add a little more milk. Pour into preheated
  pan and bake for 30 minutes or until slightly brown on top.
  
  Let cool in pan for 30 minutes.  Remove from pan and break up into very
  large chunks in a large mixing bowl. Let stand overnight, uncovered. This
  will ensure that it is dry and stale.
  
  MAKE TURKEY BROTH:  The night before, make the turkey broth.  Bring about
  12 C of water to a boil in a large pot. Thoroughly rinse turkey neck,
  giblets and gizzard. Add turkey parts, onion, celery leaves and celery
  stalk to water, cover and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer on very low
  heat for 2 hours. Strain the broth, cover, cool quickly and refrigerate.

      Title: ROAST TURKEY WITH CHESTNUT STUFFING
 Categories: Harned 1994, Main dish, Nuts, Pork, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Fresh turkey; with giblets
           -- (10 to 12 lbs.)
      4 tb Unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
           -- at room temperature
      1 lb Fresh chestnuts; peeled*
      3 c  ;Water
      1 lb Pork sausage
      2    Shallots; peeled
           -- finely chopped
    1/4 c  Fresh parsley; fine chopped
      4    Fresh thyme sprigs or
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and minced
      2    Eggs; beaten
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 lg Onions; peeled
           -- each cut into 8 wedges
      4 md Carrots; peeled
           -- cut in 2" pieces
 
  *To peel chestnuts, make a small cut on the flat side of each
  chestnut, making sure to cut all the way through the outer skin.
  Place chestnuts in a medium-size saucepan, cover with water, and
  bring to a boil over high heat.  Then reduce heat to low.  Remove
  several chestnuts from the water and peel them with a sharp paring
  knife, being sure to remove both the outer peel and the dark inner
  skin that is attached to the meat.  If the chestnuts cool before you
  have a chance to peel them, place them back in the water to heat, as
  it is virtually impossible to remove the inner skin when the chestnut
  is cool.
  
  Remove giblets and neck from the turkey; set aside.  Rinse the turkey
  well inside and out until the water runs clear.  Pat it thoroughly
  dry. Carefully separate the skin from the breast by running your
  fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to poke any
  holes in the skin.  Spread the butter on the meat.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a vegetable steamer over high heat.  Add
  the chestnuts, cover, and steam until they are tender, about 30
  minutes. Remove the steamer basket from the heat.
  
  In a medium-size bowl, gently break the chestnuts into bite-size
  pieces. Mixing well after each addition, stir in the pork, shallots,
  herbs, salt and pepper, garlic and eggs.  Chop giblets and add them
  to the mixture, mixing well.  To test for seasoning, pinch off a
  teaspoon of the mixture and cook it in a small skillet over medium
  heat until it is cooked through.  Taste for seasoning and adjust
  accordingly.
  
  Fill the turkey with as much stuffing as it will hold, but don't pack
  it tightly.  Truss the turkey.  Place the turkey in a large roasting
  pan, and pour wine around it.  Roast at 350 F. until turkey is
  golden, basting every 30 minutes with pan liquids.  If the breast is
  browning too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.  After 2
  hours, add the onions and carrots to the pan, spacing them evenly
  around the turkey.  The turkey is done when the skin is golden, the
  thigh is tender when pressed, and the leg joints move easily up and
  down in their sockets, 3 to 3 1/2 hours more.
  
  Remove turkey from the oven and from the roasting pan; let it rest
  for at least 30 minutes or as long as 45 minutes before carving.
  While it is resting, turn the turkey over so it is resting on its
  breast.  Prop the legs so they are slightly higher than the breast,
  allowing juices to run back into the breast meat.  Reduce the cooking
  juices slightly over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes, scraping up
  any brown bits.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain juices
  and pour into a gravy boat.
  
  Scoop out the stuffing into a serving dish and keep warm while you
  carve the turkey.  Serve; pass the gravy boat.
  
  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
  
  The stuffing is good for any poultry, and can be cooked on its own and
  served as a side dish to pork roast as well.  To cook the stuffing
  separately, bake it in a covered dish at 350 F. until it is nearly
  cooked all the way through, about 30 minutes.  Then remove the cover
  and continue cooking until it has browned slightly on top and is
  clearly cooked through, an additional 10 to 15 minutes.  If you cook
  the stuffing separately, your turkey may take slightly less time to
  cook.
  
  Also good accompanied by either a red Burgundy or a Volnay.

  To make dumps: With an adult's help, preheat the oven to 350F. Using clean
  hans, mix together the dump ingredients in a large bowl. Mold pieces of
  this mixture into various size/shape dumps.
  
  Place so they don't touch each other in an ungreased baking pan. Use two if
  they don''t all fit. With an adult's help, bake the dumps for about 20
  minutes or until they are all brown, firm and slightly crusty.
  
  While the meat cooks, put all four litter ingredients into a large
  saucepan. Then, with an adult's help, heat on high until the water comes to
  a boil. Stir, turn heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer without lifting
  the cover for fourteen minutes.
  
  With an adult's help, remove the saucepan from the stove and carefully (to
  avoid having your face melted away by the steam), lift off the cover. Break
  apart, or "fluff" the rice with a fork and set pan aside.
  
  When dumps are done, carefully transfer them onto paper towels to drain.
  
  Spoon the rice and dumps into the now empty baking pan, leaving some dumps
  partially uncovered, the way Kitty does when he/she is in a hurry. Serves
  8-10 litterbox lovers. Use ppper scooper to serve.

  2 1/4 c  Chicken broth, defatted
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
    1/4 c  Chopped onions
      2 md Carrots, coarsely chopped
      3 tb Cornstarch
  1 3/4 c  Evaporated skim milk

      1 c  Frozen peas, thawed
    1/4 c  Snipped fresh parsley
    1/2 ts Dried sage

--------------------------------PASTRY CRUST--------------------------------
      3    Sheets phyllo dough
 
  To Make the Turkey Mixture:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a medium
  saucepan, combine 2 cups of the broth, the celery, onions and carrots.
  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes or
  until the veggies are tender.  In a custard cup, stir the remaining 1/4 cup
  of the broth and the cornstarch until smooth. Slowly stir this into the
  broth-veggie mxiture.  Then stir in the milk. Cook and stir over medium
  heat until the mixture comes to a boil. Reuce the heat. Cook and stir for 1
  minute more. Then stir in the turkey, peas, parsely and sage. Transfer the
  mixture to a shallow 2-quart casserole.
  
  To Make the Pastry Crust:  Lay one sheet of the phyllo dough on top of the
  turkey mixture.  Spray the dough with no stick spray.  Repeat layering and
  spraying the phyllo dough two more times.  Fold or crumple the edges of the
  dough and tuck them inside the casserole dish.  Bake for 35-40 minutes or
  until golden brown.
  
  I added potatoes, mixed veggies, tobasco sauce and some liquid smoke to
  enhance the flavor.  Very good and light.  Even though the phyllo dough
  crust will get soft once you refrigerate it, it will get flaky again if you
  reheat it in the oven.

  breaking up as the slices dry out.  Use good bread ~ the cheap stuff is NOT
  as good! Keep covered with a clean dish towel, do NOT seal with lid.
  PREPARATION AND COOKING:  Clean a a thawed turkey (thaw in the refrigerator
  about 3-4 days for a 20 pound turkey). Place the turkey breast DOWN in a
  large roasting pan (enamel is great). Add the neck and giblets. Slice about
  2 sticks of butter and place these all over the turkey. Open one can
  chicken broth and pour in the bottom of the pan.
  If the roaster lid fits, use it to cover the turkey.  If it doesn't, make
  a cover with heavy foil by tearing off two pieces of foil about 12 inches
  longer than the pan and make a "sealed" fold along the lengthwise edges.
  Put over the turkey like a tent - that is, leave some space in the center
  rather than having the foil touch the turkey. Pinch the edges of the foil
  tightly around all edges to seal juices in as turkey bakes.
  Bake in a 325 degree oven until about 1 hour BEFORE the turkey is
  completely done!  You'll have to check a 20 lb turkey in about 2 1/2 hours
  or 3 hours. If your turkey is TOO done, it will not be as good. Ideally,
  the meat should not be falling away from the bones.
  Set a timer for 2 1/2 hours... and about 1 hour before you think the
  turkey is ready for adding the stuffing, begin preparing it.  Do NOT
  prepare too far ahead of time.
  Dice the onions and celery hearts/leaves (if you don't have hearts, use
  lots of leaves - this is one of the "secrets" of my stuffing). Together,
  the onions and celery should equal at least 6 cups, more or less.
  Remove the turkey carefully.  Move the turkey to another container (I use
  the roaster lid or an aluminum baking pan). Pour the broth through a
  strainer into the sauce pan you'll be using to make the gravy. Retain the
  rest for the stuffing. If more liquid is needed, use cans of chicken broth
  and/or 1 stick of butter to 1 cup of water. Into a large container (I use
  the huge Tupperware bowl), put the dried corn bread, bread, onions &
  celery. Pour in any left-over broth. This may be hot, so wait for it to
  cool.  Mix with a large wooden spoon. Add enough chicken broth to cool the
  mixture enough that it can be mixed with your hands. Each hardened piece of
  corn bread and bread should be smashed with your fingers. When the mixture
  is cool enough that it won't cook the eggs, add the eggs. Remember to break
  the eggs into another container. This will prevent egg shells in your
  stuffing!!! (Eggs in stuffing: Another secret.) Add salt, lots of pepper,
  and lots of sage.  Mix by hand, adding more broth as needed for a nice
  thick and moist mixture - not too sloppy. Taste it! This is where YOUR
  judgment comes into play.  The stuffing should have a hint of pepper, and a
  definite taste of sage.
  When the stuffing looks right and tastes right, start putting it in the
  bottom of the roaster. Put in enough so that you have about 1/2" of
  stuffing in the pan. Now place the turkey ON TOP of the stuffing, breast
  UP. Continue adding the stuffing all around the turkey.  If you have
  enough, you can completely bury the turkey in stuffing! Bury the neck and
  giblets in the stuffing - push then in and cover them.
  (My favorite part of the turkey is the neck - no one in my family DARES to
  use it in gravy!)  If you want giblet gravy (ugh!) hold back the giblets
  and do your thing with them.
  Cover as before, return to the oven for about 2 hours, or until celery and
  onions are tender.  Make gravy by adding a couple of large scoops of
  stuffing into the retained broth. Make thickening of flour and water (or
  cornstarch) to thicken your gravy as desired.  If you don't have enough
  broth, open another can of Chicken broth!
  This turkey is NOT "pretty as a picture" but I guarantee it's the most
  delicious way in the world to prepare turkey and stuffing (or chicken and
  stuffing).  Clem's grandmother raised fourteen children and this was the
  only way to prepare enough "dressing" for the entire family. Of course, she
  cooked her meals in a wood cook stove.  This method of preparation was
  handed down to Clem's mother who then taught it to me....Joyce Kohl

 Categories: Beans, Chili, Ground beef, Diabetic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Pinto Beans
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Green Pepper, chopped
      1 lb Ground Beef, extra lean -or-
           -Ground Turkey
      2    To 3 Garlic Cloves, minced
      1 tb Chili Powder
      2 ts Cumin
      2 ts Cayenne Pepper (optional)
     28 oz Can Tomatoes, drained
      6 oz Can Tomato Sauce
 
  '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' Preheat oven to
  400 deg F.
   In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt. In
  another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter until it
  dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the dry ingredients
  and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a
  well-floured board and knead for a minute or so. Divide the dough into 2
  equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll out to to fit the bottom of a
  pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2 lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for
  12-15 minutes, or until dough is golden brown.
   In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with the remaining 3 T
  sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.
   Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch. Place 1
  round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top with the
  other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best served fresh
  and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly beaten heavy cream
  if you'd like.
   Sprinkle sliced strawberries with sugar; set aside.
   Beat milk with lemon juice until thick. Fold in strawberries and whipped
  cream. Divide among crepes; fold. Garnish with additional whipped cream and
  a strawberry centered on the cream. Yields 6 servings.
   Soak gelatin in milk, in custard cup. Set cup in boiling water; stir until
  gelatin is completely dissolved.
   Combine yogurt, sugar, and salt. Stir in gelatin mixture. Stir in berries
  and lemon juice. Chill until slightly thickened; beat until foamy. Fold in
  whipped cream. Pour mixture in metal ice-cube tray. Cover with foil;
  freeze.
   NOTE: I have also made this with approx 1/2 of 1 pint of fresh
  strawberries, well crushed. I then froze it in a Donvier ice cream maker.
  Delicious!
  * hulled, cleaned, and halved
  
   Combine strawberries and sugar. Cover; let stand 15 minutes.
   Prepare topping. Beat together yolks, 1/3 cup sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and
  brandy until smooth. Fold in yopurt.

      8 c  Soft breadcrumbs or
           -unseasoned croutons
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
      2 tb Poultry seasoning
      1 ts Dried whole oregano
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/3 lb Italian sausage
      4 c  Onion; chopped
      2 c  Cooking apples
           -- peeled and chopped
    2/3 c  Canned chestnuts; chopped
    1/3 c  Pine nuts
      2    Eggs; beaten
      1 ts Dried whole rosemary
           -- crushed
  1 1/2 c  Chablis or other dry white
           -wine
 
  Remove giblets and neck from turkey; rinse and place in a small
  saucepan with 3 cups water.  Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and
  simmer 30 minutes.  Remove giblets and neck from broth, reserving
  broth.  Set aside and let cool.
  
  Combine breadcrumbs and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl, stirring
  well. Set aside.
  
  Remove sausage from casing.  Cook sausage in a large skillet over high
  heat until sausage browns, stirring to crumble meat.  Remove meat
  with a slotted spoon, reserving pan drippings in skillet.  Add
  sausage to breadcrumb mixture; stir well.  Add onion to pan drippings
  in skillet; cook over medium heat until golden.  Remove with a
  slotted spoon and stir into breadcrumb mixture.  Combine apples,
  chestnuts and pine nuts.  Add to breadcrumb mixture, stirring well.
  Remove meat from reserved turkey neck; coarsely chop meat and
  giblets.  Stir meat and giblets into breadcrumb mixture.  Combine
  eggs and 1 cup reserved broth; stir well.  Pour over breadcrumb
  mixture and stir well.
  
  Rinse turkey with cold water; pat dry.  Stuff dressing into body
  cavities of turkey.  If excess skin around tail has been cut away,
  tuck legs under flap of skin around tail.  If skin is intact, close
  cavity with skewers and truss.  Tie ends of legs to tail with cord.
  Lift wingtips up and over back; tuck under bird.  Spoon remaining
  dressing into a greased 11 x 7 x 2" baking dish.  Cover and chill.
  
  Place turkey in a shallow roasting pan, breast side up; rub bird with
  crushed rosemary.  Pour wine into roasting pan around bird.  Insert
  meat thermometer in meaty part of turkey thigh, making sure
  thermometer does not touch bone.  Bake at 325 F. until meat
  thermometer reaches 185 F.  If turkey starts to brown too much, cover
  loosely with aluminum foil.
  
  When turkey is two-thirds done, cut the cord or band of skin holding
  drumstick ends to tail; this will ensure that the thighs are cooked
  internally.  Turkey is done when drumsticks are easily moved up and
  down. Let stand 15 minutes before carving.
  
  Bake remaining dressing at 350 F. for 30 to 40 minutes.

      Title: WHITE BEAN CHILI WITH TURKEY
 Categories: Chili, Vegetables, Salads, Beans/peas
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           -----chili-------
      1 lb Dried white beans
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2 c  Chopped onions
      2    4 oz can diced green chilies
      6    Cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/2 tb Dried oregano; crushed
      1 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Chili powder
      7 c  Chicken broth
     18 oz Fresh or canned tomatillos
           -chopped, about 3 1/2 cups
      1 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
  1 1/2 lb Boneless skinless turkey
           -breast, cut crosswise
           -in half
      1 c  Chopped green onions
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
           -----cilantro cream--------
    2/3 c  Plain yogurt
      3 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      3 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
           ------garnish------
           Fresh cilantro sprigs
    1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
 
    For chili: The recipe recommends soaking the beans overnight.
  Personally, I don't like to do that. I find the quick soak method
  works better. That is, cover beans with cold water. Bring to a boil
  and boil for 1-2 min. Turn off heat and let soak for 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain beans.  Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy Dutch oven over
  medium heat. Add chopped onion and saute 5 minutes.  Add diced
  chilies, minced garlic, oregano, cumin, and chili powder. Saute for 5
  minutes. Add beans, chicken broth, chopped tomatillos and cilantro.
  It's important that the chicken broth contain little or no salt. Salt
  inhibits the softening of the seed coat of beans. Therefore, if you
  add salt too early the beans with never soften up. Add turkey breast
  and simmer until just cooked through, about 20 minutes. Transfer
  turkey to plate. Cover with foil and refrigerate. Simmer chili until
  beans are tender, about 2 1/2 hours.  Cut turkey into 1/2 inch pieces.
  Add turkey, green onions and lime juice to chili. Stir. Heat through.
  Season with salt and pepper.
  
  For cilantro cream: Combine yogurt, parsley, chopped cilantro in a
  medium bowl.  Ladle chili into bowls. Top with spoonful of cilantro
  cream. Sprinkle with cilantro sprigs and cheese.  Can be prepared 1
  day ahead. Cover chili and cilantro cream separately and refrigerate.
  Before serving, reheat chili over low heat.  Like most chili, it
  tastes better the second day.  From Bon Appetit September 1992

 Categories: Turkey, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Turkey, cooked; cubed
  1 1/3 c  Cheddar; coarsely grated
      4 oz Green chiles; drained
      1 c  Flour, whole wheat
    1/4 c  Corn meal
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/4 c  ;Water, cold
      1 tb Milk
      4 ts Corn meal; for topping
 
  Mix together turkey, cheese and chilies; set aside.  In a different
  bowl, mix together flour, cornmeal and salt.  Cut in butter until
  particles are the size of small peas (a pastry blender makes this an
  easy job). Sprinkle with water and mix with pastry blender or fork
  until pastry can be formed into a ball.  Add a little more water if
  necessary. Divide dough into balls, one ball for each two servings;
  divide turkey mixture into same number as dough. Turn one dough ball
  onto floured board and roll into an 11" square. Place on oiled cookie
  sheet. Spoon one part of turkey mixture over 1/2 of pastry, coming to
  1 1/2" of the edge.  Fold other half of pastry over it, and crimp
  edges to seal them.  Repeat this procedure with each ball of dough.
  Brush turnovers with milk.  Sprinkle remaining corn meal on top. Bake
  at 400 degrees for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to cool
  slightly; slice into wedges to serve.

  1 2/3 c  Liquid -- (water + chicken
           Bro
      1 ts Curry Powder
    1/4 ts Red Pepper Flakes
      3 sm Carrots -- sliced

    1/2 c  Fresh Mushrooms -- chopped
      5 oz Cooked Chicken Or Turkey --
           Chopped
    2/3 c  Frozen Peas
 
  * (use white if you prefer, but since it doesn't take as long to cook,
  you may want to cook the vegetables a bit before adding the rice.)
  
  Put rice and liquid in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add curry,
  pepper flakes, carrots, celery, leek, kale and mushrooms.  Return to a
  boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until most of
  the liquid is absorbed.  Add meat and peas, and cook another 5 minutes.
  Serve.  This served 2 very (!) hungry adults.  You could
  probably stretch it to 3 by adding a bit more rice and liquid

  very
  easy to make and tasty too.  Since my six-year-old daughter asked me to
  make this dish again, days ago, I made it for this evenings dinner. She's

  favorites. :)

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      9 lb To 13 lb turkey
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh sage, or:
      2 ts Dried sage, crushed
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary, or:
      2 ts Dried rosemary, crushed
      1 tb Chopped fresh thyme, or:
      1 ts Dried thyme, crushed
           Salt
           Cracked black pepper
 
  Use indirect heat, as explained in the recipe to cook a whole turkey or
  turkey breast. Allow 1 3/4 to 3 1/4 hours' cook- ing time, depending on the
  size of your turkey and heat of the coals.
  
  Prepare coals and grill.
  
  Remove neck and giblets from turkey. Rinse turkey under cold water; drain
  and pat dry with paper towels.
  
  Combine oil, herbs and seasonings in a small bowl. Generously brush on
  cavities and outer surface of turkey, reserv- ing some mixture to use as a
  baste.
  
  Pull turkey skin over the neck; secure with a skewer. Tuck wings under back
  and tie legs together with kitchen twine.
  
  Arrange medium-hot briquettes on two sides of a large metal or foil drip
  pan. Fill the pan halfway with hot tap water.
  
  Place turkey, breast side up, on grill, directly above the drip pan. Cover
  grill and cook turkey 11 to 15 minutes per pound, or until an instant-read
  meat thermometer registers 180 degrees F, basting occasionally with
  reserved herb mixture.
  
  Add a few briquettes to both sides of the fire every hour or as necessary
  to maintain a constant temperature.
  
  Garnish with additional fresh herbs, if desired.

           -- removed
    1/2 c  Cream, heavy
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, green
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, pink (do not
           -- use South American pink
           -- peppercorns)
    1/2 c  Veal, chicken, or white meat
           -- of turkey, ground fine
      6    Mushrooms, shiitake, diced
           -- (Morels may be subbed)
      1 ds Nutmeg
           Salt (to taste)
           Pepper (to taste)

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1 c  Cognac (leftover marinade
           -- sauce from chicken)
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, green
    1/2 ts Peppercorns, pink
      1 c  Veal, demi-glace
    1/2 c  Cream, heavy

----------------------------------ASSEMBLY----------------------------------
           Vegetables for garnish
           -- (carrots, turnips,
           -- string beans or
           -- zucchini)
 
  For the Chicken: ================
  
       To bone the chicken, producing two servings (or globi) per chicken,
  begin by cutting down along the breast bone, scraping along the bone to
  keep the meat intact.  Disjoint the wing and continue boning along the
  wishbone.
  
       Turn the chicken over and cut along the back bone, carving out the
  meat from the bone.  Disjoint the thigh and continue to remove the entire
  half of the chicken with the skin intact.
  
       Cut off the wing at the first joint leaving only the shoulder bone
  attached to the carcass.  Scrape the meat off of this remaining wing bone
  to remove the bone, leaving meat and skin attached to the half chicken.
  
       Remove the thigh bone, leaving meat attached to the chicken half. Cut
  around the knob end of the leg, releasing the skin and the tendons. Press
  the leg meat and skin firmly toward the thigh so that 1 1/2 to 2 inches of
  the leg bone is exposed.  Cut the knob off the end of the leg bone.
  
       Repeat the process with the second half of the chicken.
  
       Marinate the chicken meat for one hour in cognac, thyme and bay leaf.

      Title: CORNBREAD MASON-DIXON STUFFING
 Categories: Grains, Stuffing, Poultry
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      4 c  Dry cornbread crumbs
           (from your favorite NON-
           SWEET cornbread recipe)
      4 c  Dry white bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      2    Onions, chopped
      6    Ribs celery (including
           -some tops), chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans or walnuts
      1 cn Corn, undrained, OPTIONAL
           Chicken broth/turkey stock
           -to moisten
           Sage, thyme, salt and
           -pepper to taste
 
  As a Californian, married into a Southern family, I can warn you that the
  traditional cornbread stuffing probably isn't gonna be to his taste. The
  first time I had the stuff, I found it gritty, nasty, and just plain wierd.
  
  Wes, on the other hand, was less than enthralled by the sage-laden stuff
  that *I* think ought to go into a bird.  Now, we compromise, with a
  dressing that we both enjoy.
  
  Crumble the cornbread and white bread into a big bowl.
  
  Melt the butter in a large frying pan, add the onions and celery, and cook
  over low heat until the vegetables are soft, but not browned. Dump the
  butter/vegetable mixture over the bread.  Stir in the nuts, canned corn and
  its liquid (if used), seasonings.  Add broth to moisten to the consistancy
  you like (Western-style dressing tends to be a bit dryer than the Southern
  version).

      Title: HOLIDAY TURKEY
 Categories: Turkey
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Turkey
           Margarine; room temperature
           Salt, kosher
           Pepper
      2 lg Onion; quartered
      1    Celery stalk; w/leaves
      2 c  ;Water
           Flour
           ;Water
 
  Cut the celery in large pieces.  Mix some flour and water together and make
  a thick, creamy "kid's paste," then water it down a bit. Thaw any size
  turkey.  Wash it down real good in the sink and don't be ashamed of
  scrubbing her down good.  Make the old girl sing like Ethel Merman.  My
  kids lived for this event each year as all my turkeys sang in the shower as
  if their forthcoming debut was at Town Hall. This bird you're washing is
  the star of the show and should be treated as such. You'll have more fun
  watching the turkey bathe if you select a noted singer.  I've cooked
  several Ethel Merman turkeys and a Kate Smith or two and I remember one
  Billie Holiday bird.
  
  Slightly dry Ethel with paper towels.  Grab a handful of margarine and rub
  it between your hands.  Now rub the star as if she's getting her final
  massage.  Make sure you get plenty of margarine rubbed into the bird. Now,
  with margarine still on your hands, rub a palmful of salt between your
  hands and apply this to the bird as you did the margarine, making sure
  plenty of salt gets rubbed in.  You need not worry about too much salt or
  margarine and a couple of handfuls may be required.
  
  Lightly pepper the bird, but don't rub this in.  Dip your hands in the
  creamy paste created from the watered down "kid's paste" of flour and
  water.  Dab this lightly on the skin all over, careful not to go over areas
  already covered with paste.   This is not a crust, but a more delicious
  sealer.
  
  Place turkey in a large roasting pan.  Place quartered onions under wings
  behind drumsticks, in the cavity, and some on the bottom of the pan to cook
  in the broth that you'll need later on.  Now place the celery along- side
  the onion and leave the celery tops in the bottom of the pan to cook in the
  broth.
  
  Pour two cups of cool water in the bottom of the pan.  DO NOT pour over the
  turkey.  Preheat oven to 350 F. and let the bird cook slow. Cover and cook
  the turkey for at least a couple of hours or until the meat turns brown and
  falls apart at the limbs.  This is a tender turkey and will not hold up to
  carving at the table.  Prepare your turkey platter on the kitchen cabinet
  as this bird will fall apart if you try and lift it. After the turkey has
  cooked for at least 1-1/2 hours, baste the turkey every 30 minutes. Drain
  off broth and reserve to make the stuffing.

      Title: MANCHA MANTELES
 Categories: Mexican, Loo
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Small turkey, in serving
           Pieces, or 2 chickens
    1/2 c  Lard
      2    Ancho chiles, chopped
      2    Pasilla chiles, chopped
      2    Serrano chiles, chopped
      4 oz Almonds,blanched,slivered
      1 tb White sesame seeds
      2    Chorizos, peeled/chopped
      1 lg Onion, sliced thin
    1/2 lb Tomatoes, peeled, seeded,
           And chopped
      1 ts Cinnamon powder
      2 c  Turkey or chicken stock
      1 tb Sugar
      5 ts Cider vinegar
      1 ts Salt or to taste
      4 oz Pineapple, chunked
      2    Firm cooking apples,
           Peeled, cored, & sliced
      1 lg Unripe banana, peeled
           And sliced
 
  This looks very much like Mancha manteles, which Richard [Manchurian
  Candidate] Condon describes in The Mexican Stove:
  
    Two little women staggered in from another room carrying a gigantic
    bowl of something which was jetting hot perfume. The sen~ora hoped
    I enjoyed mancha manteles. Reyes explained that this was the second
    Mexican meal of my life, ... but that he knew that I would -love-
    mancha manteles. The sen~ora beamed and instructed me to eat heart-
    ily, remembering that the translation of mancha manteles was: ta-
    blecloth stainer. I was sweating hard as she overdid me the honor
    of preparing my plate, a very wide plate, perhaps a foot in diam-
    eter. The tablecloth stainer contains the following: one turkey,
    four chorizo sausages, sliced pineapples, sliced apples, sliced
    bananas, some pork; ancho, pasilla and serrano chiles; almonds,
    cinnamon, lard, and tomato puree. Reyes scooped away as though
    he had picked up a fake stomach at Macy's. I got through it. ...
    A very peculiar physiological metamorphosis happened to Reyes
    that afternoon. When he entered the chairman's house he was a
    well-set-up, definitely not stout fellow who spoke American with
    a marked California accent. After that dinner he was not only a
    stout man - and I mean a shorter, rounder, fatter man with a
    pronounced paunch - but his speech changed. He would ramble in
    the diction of a jazz musician or break into voluble Spanish.
    Not that the sen~ora's meal taught him to speak Spanish. He had
    always spoken Spanish. But never to Jewish delicatessen waiters,
    for example, or to austere British bootmakers.
  
  Brown turkey in lard. Remove. Pour off fat, leaving 2 T in the pan. Fry
  chiles, almonds, and sesame seeds together until fragrant. Blend to a puree
  in a blender. Fry chorizo meat in the fat that remains in the pan. Remove.
  In the same fat, cook onions until soft. Add blended mixture, tomatoes, and
  cinnamon. Cook a few minutes and then turn out the whole mess into a large
  casserole. Mix in the stock, sugar, vinegar, and salt. Taste for seasoning.
  Add browned turkey pieces, chorizo meat, and fruit. Cover and simmer 45 min
  to 1 hr. After Richard Condon's recipe and description.

      Title: MOIST HOLIDAY TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     18 lb Tom Or Hen Turkey *
    1/4 lb Butter
      3 tb Fresh Orange Juice
           Stuffing of Choice **
           Salt
 
  * Fresh or frozen. ** Do not add any salt to your stuffing mix.
  ~--------------------------------------------------------------------- ~--
  Preheat oven to 325øF.  Remove the giblets from the bird.  Rub the inside
  of the clean body cavity with salt until there is a coating of salt over
  the whole inside.  This holds the juice inside the bird and the salt will
  season your dressing. Even after cooking most of the salt will remain
  inside of the body cavity. Place the stuffing in the bird and close the
  body cavity.  Melt the butter and add the orange juice. Baste the bird with
  the butter/orange juice mixture. Place a meat thermometer between the thigh
  and body in the meaty part of the thigh, not touching any bone. Bake the
  bird until the thermometer reads 190øF, basting frequently. When the skin
  turns golden brown, tent the bird with a large sheet of aluminum foil.
  Allow the bird to cool while making gravy, then carve and serve a moist
  holiday tradition.  If you use an aluminum baking pan it will add about one
  hour to the baking time.  If a moist turkey is what you want, give this
  method a try.  I have not had any problems with using the excess salt and I
  have a problem with too much salt.  From: Syd's Cookbook.

  Full Title : Roulade of Turkey with Foie Gras and Sauterne Sauce with
  Crispy Sweet Potatoes
  
  From Peter Kelly of Piermont, N.Y.
  
  Turkey roulade: Remove skin from turkey breast with sharp knife. Slice in 4
  slices. Between sheets of plastic wrap, lightly pound turkey cutlets into
  paillardes (thin sheets). Season with Kosher salt and pepper.
  
  Divide foie gras (or chopped liver) in 4 parts and season with salt and
  pepper. Place a piece of foie gras in center of each turkey paillarde and
  roll turkey around foie gras.
  
  Carefully remove cabbage leaves, one at a time, first removing core. Boil
  cabbage leaves in a large pot just until wilted, about 3 minutes, and
  refresh under cold running water. Dry thoroughly.
  
  For each roulade, lay out 2 or 3 cabbage leaves to form a square. Place
  turkey roulade in center and wrap with cabbage, forming a tight bundle.
  Refrigerate. Sautene sauce: Over high heat, reduce 1 cup of sauterne and 1
  cup of chicken broth until sauce coats back of spoon (about 12 minutes).
  Sprinkle in 1/3 cup sun-dried cherries.
  
  Crispy sweet potatoes: Peel potato and poach in boiling water until just
  tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and slice very thin and then cut into julienne
  strips. In large saute pan, heat vegetable oil to hot, and fry potato
  strips for 1 minute, or until crisp. Pat dry with paper towels and toss
  with salt and pepper. To serve: Place roulades in center of bamboo steamer
  and steam exactly 15 minutes. Turkey will be cooked through and foie gras
  will be pink in center. Reheat sauterne sauce and spoon, with cherries, on
  4 warmed plates. Place roulade in center of each plate and arrange crispy
  sweet potatoes around.

      Title: TURKEY & CHILE SOUP
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 oz Can of tomatoes
      7 oz Can of diced green chiles
      1    Onion, cut into chunks
      3 c  Chicken broth or
           -homemade turkey stock
      3 c  Bite-size pieces of
           -cooked turkey
      2 c  Cooked brown rice
     10 oz Pk frozen whole kernel corn
    3/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/4 ts Chili powder
 
  This is a recipe that I like to use for turkey leftovers.  I use the
  carcass to make the stock first.  I throw in any vegetables I want to use
  up in the fridge into the stock pot except cabbage and broccoli and carrot
  greens which smell too strong if I let the stock boil too hard by accident.
  After straining the stock and discarding the bones and vegetables I use the
  following recipe from the Sunset "Fresh Ways with Chicken" cookbook, which
  I usually double.  I also use more broth and less turkey than they call
  for, I really don't measure the ingredients, I just add what I've got until
  it's as thick as I want it and the proportions look right.
  
  In a blender or food processor combine tomatoes and their liquid, chiles
  and onion; whirl until smooth.  Pour into a large pan, add broth and bring
  to a boil over high heat.  Add turkey, rice, corn, garlic and spices.
  Reduce heat and simmer until heated through.
  
  Serve with fresh cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips, their recipe
  calls for strips made from flour tortillas, but I use corn tortilla chips
  sometimes.  -- Sandra Chaffin (fnsjc@aurora.alaska.edu)

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Turkey breast
           Pepper
           Canola oil
           Salt
           Cayene pepper
 
  * Keep the skin on. Even thought it has the fat, it will keep the meat
  moister. Slather the skin with the canola oil. It will help with the
  browning. Most of the oil will dissipate during cooking. Sprinkle the
  breast with salt, Black pepper, and Cayenne pepper. Place the Roast on the
  grill with a moderate charcoal fire and cover. It will take about 1 hour to
  cook a 2-3 lb breast. As always check it after the hour and adjust. For
  those who are not fat intimidated, use butter instead of oil and add a
  little hickory wood for smoke. The skin will have a distinctive bacon
  flavor.

      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Pine nuts, toasted
 
  Pat the turkey fillets dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and
  pepper.
  
  You will probably need to sear the turkey in batches so that it will brown.
  Heat a large, nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Spray one side of the
  turkey fillets with Bakers Joy. Cook 1-2 minutes or until golden. Spray the
  remaining side, turn and cook for an additional minute. Hold seared turkey
  fillets on a warm plate and repeat with remainder.
  
  Add the raisins, wine, capers and chicken broth mixed with cornstarch to
  the same pan, stirring constantly until slightly thickened. Return turkey
  to the pan to heat.
  
  Serve turkey on individualy plates with sauce spooned over the top.
  Sprinkle each portion with toasted pine nuts.

      Title: TURKEY KABOBS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 swords
 
      2 lb Turkey breast, diced 1" cube
      2    Bell Peppers diced 1" cube
      1 md Onion, diced 1" cube
      1 lg Can pineapple chunks
     10 lg Mushrooms
 
  * Make sure the Kabob swords fit your grill. Either they should fit
  entirely inside the grill or long enough to place across the lip of the
  cooker like a rotisserie. This way the meat and vegetables will cook
  evenly. * Make a moderate fire.
  
  Dice all of the turkey breast, onion, and bell peppers. Alternate red and
  green peppers to make a nice presentation. Use the pineapple juice to
  marinate the mushrooms for about an hour. Thread the meat and vegetables on
  the swords as you think will make a good presentation. Cook over the fire
  until the meat is done. Baste with the pineapple juice while cooking. Serve
  with white rice.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    6 ounce Turkey Escalopes
      1    Glass Sparkling Muscatel
           -grape juice or vermouth
      5 fl Double Cream
           Salt and Pepper
      1 tb Oil
      1 tb Butter
 
  Wrap the escalopes in clingfilm and flatten gently with the back of a heavy
  frying pan until they are really thin. Peel off the clingfilm.
  
  Heat the oil then the butter in a large frying pan. Put in the meat and
  press down firmly so it is all in contact with the frying pan.
  
  Let it sizzle for between one minute and a minute and a half, depending on
  how thin you've managed to flatten the escalopes, turn them over and repeat
  the timing.
  
  The meat will be thoroughly cooked through - you do not ever want pink
  turkey - but very tender. Put the meat on warmed plates.
  
  Pour the grape juice or vermouth into the frying pan, stir it round to pick
  up all the bits from the meat, then add the double cream and let it bubble
  (double cream boils beautifully) and reduce slightly.
  
  Pour it over the turkey and serve with pasta or new potatoes and mangetout.

      Title: ULTIMATE SMOKED TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1    Turkey; 8 to 10 pounds
      1 md Onion
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  White wine
           Super smoking sauce; (see r
           -ecipe)
 
      Rinse turkey, pat dry and rub liberally with oil (we'd rub it with
  Liquid Smoke instead). Place onion, bay leaves and wine in water pan with
  hot water (we'd add a few sticks of celery and a few cloves of garlic).
  Place water pan in smoker and turkey on grid (it won't hurt to put a
  quartered onion, a few stalks of celery and a bay leaf inside the turkey;
  we also sometimes mix freshly ground black pepper, a bit of salt and some
  crushed thyme together and after loosening the breast skin with your hands,
  push this mix up under the skin and spread over the breast of the turkey).
  Place dome on smoker and do not remove until midway through cooking time.
  Then remove dome and liberally paint turkey with Super Smoking Sauce.
  Replace dome and continue smoking. When turkey is done, liberally paint
  again and allow to smoke for 15 minutes more. Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
  Charcoal:  Use 10 pounds charcoal, 5 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks (we
  use about 5 to 8 presoaked wood blocks) and smoke 4 to 6 hours. Electric:
  Use 4 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks and smoke 4 to 6 hours. Add water to
  water pan after about 4 hours or as needed (you can tell when smoker needs
  water by the sizzling sound it will make). Recipe from "Cook'n Cajun Water
  Smoker Cookbook" by Sondra Hester. Submitted By Z@FYBITS.COM (Z PEGASUS) On

      1 lg Onion, Peeled and Diced
     12 oz New or Waxy potatoes, peeled

      6 oz Sweetcorn Kernels
      1 tb Oil
 
  Heat the oil in a flameproof casserole and fry the turkey pieces until
  golden brown.
  
  Add the onions, potatoes and pepper. Mix in the tomatoes, breaking them unp
  slightly with a fork. add the herbs and enough water just to cover the
  turkey.
  
  Simmer on top of the stove or in an oven preheated to gas mark 4/350F/180C

  If the sauce is very thin, dissolve a teaspoon of cornflour in a little

      1 ts Salt for water
      4 c  Shredded mozzarella cheese
           -low cal, low fat
      3    Jars pasta sauce of your
           -choice (or 8 cups)
      2 lb Low-fat ricotta cheese
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Low-fat parmesan cheese
      3 tb Parsley flakes
      1 tb Italian seasoning
      2 lb Turkey italian sausage
      1 ts Honey
      1 ts Salt
           Pepper to taste
      4    Eggs (or egg substitute to
           -equal 4 eggs)
           Parmesan cheese to taste
 
  1. Heat sufficient water in a large sauce pan to cook the lasagna noodles.
  Add the salt to the water to speed cooking. Add the uncooked noodles to the
  boiling water, and boil about 10 minutes or until flexi- ble but not fully
  cooked. Drain on aluminum foil or waxed paper and cool completely.
  
  2. In a large saute pan, saute turkey italian sausage until completely
  cooked. Crumble. Drain and set aside.
  
  3. In a large mixing bowl, add ricotta cheese and mix in eggs whisking one
  at a time to blend well. Add parmesan cheese, mozarella cheese, parsley,
  sugar, honey, salt, italian seasoning, pepper, and mix well.
  
  4. In a very large (roasting pan size) baking pan, add 1/2 cup of the sauce
  to the bottom. Line the bottom with lasagna noodles; add 1/2 of the cheese
  mixture, and then add 1/2 of the sausage on top of the cheese. Add 1 to 1
  1/2 cups of sauce over this layer, top with noodles and repeat process.
  When the final layer of noodles is added, top with sauce and additional
  mozarella cheese and parmesan cheese, if desired.
  
  5. Heat oven to 400F. Bake for 30 minutes covered, then uncover and bake
  for an additional 30 minutes or until cheese is bubbly (and the pan is
  sufficiently dripping to make a mess ;). Serve in 4 x 3 squares.
