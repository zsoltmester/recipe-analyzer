  Several hours before serving-or the day before, if time allows, rub
  the chicken pieces pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep
  china or earthenware bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the
  garlic clove and pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate
  the chicken.  Turn chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook,
  preheat the broiler to its highest setting. Arrange the chicken pieces
  on the broiler rack and baste with a little of the melted butter
  mixture.  (Reserve part of the basting mixture to serve over the
  chicken when served.)  Broil the chicken 3-4 inches from the heat for
  5-8 minutes per side, basting often. Chicken is done when juices run
  clear when pierced with a sharp knife.  Remove to serving platter,

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned
      2 T  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter
    1/4 c  Champagne; dry

      6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin
      3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
      1 T  Butter or margarine
 
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
  chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
  large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
  cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
  minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a simmer.
  Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or over
  rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish of
  Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place each
  half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat tenderizer
  until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until tender. Divide
  shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading evenly over
  each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half, fold in half,
  and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes on each side in
  the butter and olive oil listed in the original ingredients. Chicken
  is done when it springs back when lightly pressed with finger. Follow
  the balance of the instructions listed above for the sauce. Source:
  The original recipe came from "The Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet"
  published by Culbertson Winery. The "additional ingredients"
  modification is my own.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Peanuts; raw
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2 ea Whole chicken breasts at roo
      1 ea Large egg white
  1 1/2 T  Water chestnut flour
      1 x  -----------sauce------------
      4 ea Green onions
      2 ea Large cloves garlic
      1 T  Minced ginger root

    1/2 T  Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 t  Chili paste with garlic
      1 T  Dry sherry
      1 ea Pinch sugar
      1 ea Cornstarch paste
 
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  +++++ Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
  white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in
  2-quart saucepan. Reserve. Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken
  meat from bones.  Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1"
  chunks.  In bowl large enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water
  chestnut flour.  Beat mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg
  beater or whisk).  Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
  thoroughly.  Marinate 5 minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a
  lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
  (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a
  light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or
  paper bag. Reserve. Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk
  first:  chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2
  minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry
  no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to
  keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long
  chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve. Sauce:  While deep-frying
  chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions & peanuts about a
  minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken pieces to
  sauce, mix quickly & serve.

      Title: CHICKEN MILANESE
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 ea Chicken breast halves; skin
    3/4 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
      2 T  Parmesan; freshly grated
    3/4 c  Breadcrumbs; fresh white
      1 T  Parsley; minced fresh
    1/8 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Pepper; freshly ground
      1 ea Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 c  Olive oil
      2 T  Butter; unsalted
      2 T  Lemon juice; fresh
      1 ea Lemon; quartered
      1 x  Parsley springs; fresh
 
  Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of
  3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling pin.  Mix cheese, breadcrumbs,
  minced parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in
  medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb
  mixture, coating completely and pressing to adhere.  Shake off excess
  breadcrumbs.  Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add
  chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4
  minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels and drain.
  Transfer chicken to platter. Melt butter in small saucepan. Mix in
  lemon juice and pour over chicken.  Garnish with lemon wedges and
  parsley sprigs. *** My notes:  I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and
  breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I reduced
  the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for 6
  breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
  enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

      1 c  Salsa, mild red or green
      8 ea Romaine lettuce leaves,large
      2 T  Vegetable Oil
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 200.
  2. Cut the chicken breast crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Place the
  chicken in a small bowl.
  3. Add 6 tablespoons of the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the coriander
  (if using), the cumin, cornstarch, salt and pepper and mix gently until
  the chicken is well coated; set aside.
  4. Stack the tortillas and wrap them in foil. Place them in the oven to
  warm for 5 to 10 minutes.
  5. Maenwhile make the sauce: In a small bowl, stir together the salsa and
  the remaining 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 4 tablespoons of
  coriander (if using).
  6. Shred the lettuce.
  7. In a medium skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Add the
  chicken and saute until white and firm, about 5 minutes.
  8. Place the tortillas, chicken, shredded lettuce, sauce and sour cream in
  serving dishes. The diners can then assemble their own fajitas by
  topping a tortilla with some of each of the ingredients, ending with a
  dollop of sour cream, and then rolling it up.
  TIME-SAVERS:
  MICROWAVE TIP: Just before serving, stack the tortillas and wrap them in a
  damp paper towel. Cook at 100% for 1 minute.
  DO-AHEAD: Since the fajitas are fine served at room temperature, much of
  the preparation can be done ahead of time. The sauce (Step 5) can be
  made and the chicken marinated in advance. Just be sure to cook the
  chicken and warm the tortillas as close to serving time as possible.

    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Soy sauce

      1 x  Trimmed of fat
 
      In a large bowl, combine the allspice, thyme, cayenne pep- per,
  black  pepper, sage, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, garlic powder and sugar.
  With a wire whisk, slowly add the olive oil, soy sauce, vinegar,
  orange juice, and lime juice.  Add the Scotch bonnet pepper,. onion,
  and green onions and mix well.  Add the chicken breasts, cover and
  marinate for at least 1 hour,  longer if possible.
      Preheat an outdoor grill.
      Remove the breasts from the marinade and grill for 6 minutes on
  each side or until fully cooked.  While grilling, baste with the
  marinade.
      Heat the leftover marinade and serve on the side for dipping.
      NOTE:  This is the recipe as listed in the cookbook.  Per-
  sonally, I would NEVER heat the leftover marinade and serve on the
  side for dipping, especially something that you had marinated POULTRY
  in.  A MUCH better idea would be to reserve some of the marinade
  (BEFORE you put the chicken in it) and save it for serving.
      This recipe is also from Sugar Reef Caribbean Cooking by Devra
  Dedeaux.  "This recipe is not as hot as you would find in Jamaica.
  For that authentic flavor, double the quantity of dry spices."

      Title: BLACKENED CHICKEN
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     16    3 oz skinless chicken breast

-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      2 T  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Garlic powder
  1 1/2 t  Ground black pepper
      1 t  White pepper
      1 t  Onion powder
      1 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Gound cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Sweet paprika

-----------------------------OTHER INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter
 
  NOTE: Recipe calls for 16 (3-ounce) skinless boned
  chicken breasts, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, or 8
  (10-ounce) bone-in leg-thigh pieces, or a combination
  of these.  Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then bone each
  piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat
  in one piece.  Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast
  or leg-thigh fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken
  come to room temperature before blackening.
   Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
  small bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over
  very high heat until it is extremely hot and just
  short of the point at which you see white ash or a
  white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8
  minutes.  (the time will vary according to the
  intensity of the heat source.)    Heat the serving
  plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  piece of chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that
  both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each fillet
  evenly with the seasoning mix, using about a rounded
  1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with your
  hands.  (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other
  surface to season it, be sure the surface is warm so
  the butter won't congeal and stick to the surface
  instead of to the meat.  Wipe the surface clean after
  seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning
  mix in another recipe.)
     Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in
  the hot skillet, making sure all meat folds are opened
  up and the meat is lying flat.  Pour about 1 teaspoon
  butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as the
  butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet
  at a time, place each fillet in the skillet before
  buttering and seasoning another one.    Cook uncovered
  over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes.  (The time will vary according
  to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the
  skillet or fire;  watch the meat and you'll see a
  white line coming up the side as it cooks.)  Turn the
  fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon more melted
  butter on top of each.  Cook just until meat is cooked
  through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken
  fillets crustier side up while piping hot.    Clean
  the skillet after cooking each batch and repeat the
  blackening procedure with the remaining chicken
  fillets.    To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1
  leg-thigh fillet on each heated serving plate.  If you
  use a large serving platter, do not stack the fillets.
  Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done
  either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The
  process creates an incredible amount of smoke that
  will set off your own and your neighbors' smoke
  alarms.  People with really well-installed commercial
  hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in
  their own kitchens.  They are privileged!  Don't push
  your luck."

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Long grain rice
      1 c  Water
      1    Whole chicken breast
      3 T  Cornstarch
      3 T  Water
      1 T  Soy sauce
      6 c  Chicken stock
      2 c  Shredded watercress, OR

    1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions
      1 t  Dark sesame oil (opt)
           Salad oil for deep frying
 
  Preparation: Skin, bone and cut the chicken breast into julienne strips.
  
  Rice: In a large heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, combine rice and water over
  high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium and cook 10
  minutes. Drop heat to low and cook for an additional 30 minutes without
  removing the lid. The crusty rice around the sides and bottom will stick to
  the pan. This will be used in the soup. Take off the top layer of softer
  rice and reserve for another use. Lift out the crusty rice and place on a
  cookie sheet to dry at room temperature, or place in a glass baking dish in
  a microwave oven for 10 minutes on low. If the rice is dried at room
  temperature, allow 12-24 hours before deep frying.
  
  Soup: Toss the strips of chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the
  cornstarch. Set aside. In a small container, combine remaining 2
  tablespoons of cornstarch with water and soy sauce. Heat stock just to
  boiling. Stir in soy mixture and chicken. Simmer 5 minutes. Add the
  shredded greens, onions and sesame oil, if desired. Keep the soup hot (but
  not boiling) while frying rice. Heat oil to 375 degrees in a deep-fryer or
  heavy saucepan. Fry rice 3 to 5 minutes until puffed and lightly browned.

  LAY 2 SLICES OF HAM on 1 side of the butterflied breast. Refold the breast,
  enclosing the ham. Lay the breast on a sheet of caul fat. Roll up tight.

  oil in a wok to 350F (moderate). Slide the chicken breasts into the oil, 1
  by 1. When they have browned (about 5 minutes), remove 1 from the oil and
  press it. If it feels mushy, it needs more cooking. Remove and drain the
  chicken. Slice the chicken, crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.
  
  VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a wok and flavor with garlic and ginger.
  Remove the garlic and ginger and add the water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and
  scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then add soy sauce, wine or
  sherry, and chicken broth. When the liquid boils, stir in the dissolved
  cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread the sauce on a platter as a bed for

      1    2-in piece of tamarind pulp
           Peanut or corn oil
           -(for deep-frying)
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles
      6 oz Med shrimp
           - shelled and deveined
      1    Whole boned chicken breast

      1 tb Minced garlic
      2 sm Serrano chiles
           - finely minced
      1    Lime (zest only)
  3 1/2 tb Tomato paste
      4 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
      3 tb Fresh lime juice
      4    Green onions; trimmed,
           - cut into 1-in lengths
           - blanched
      3 tb Fresh coriander leaves
    1/2 lb Bean sprouts; tails removed
           - (for garnish)

------------------------------CRISPY EGG LACE------------------------------
           Oil for deep-frying
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a fork
  and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press
  it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep
  saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper
  bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the
  oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds.
  Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat
  with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it
  at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are
  done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil
  over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1
  minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and
  set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to
  the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add
  tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a
  dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the
  wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3
  to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the
  reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer
  together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture,
  green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through.
  Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently
  crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of
  noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat.
  Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace
  (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.
  
  CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep
  oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a
  medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let
  eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until
  lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular
  lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break
  into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces. ---

           -ground
      4 ts Olive oil
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      2 tb Matza meal*
      8 c  Chicken broth
           -salt

      4    Matzot;regular, broken into
           -large pieces
 
  * Matza meal and Matzots may purchase in some supermarkets and Jewish
  grocery stores.
  
  (The word Hammin (or Hammim) is derived from the Hebrew adjective Ham or
  warm which describes certain dishes that are kept warm for prolonged
  periods of time...In Pitigliano, however Hammin was the classic one-course
  meal for Passover that both rich and poor used to make. The only difference
  between the versions was the in the cuts of meat used. Poor people used
  breast of lamb..and meatballs made with beef(when the cost of ground beef
  was a fraction of the cost of chicken.) People who didn't have to worry
  about the cost used tiny rib chops from baby lamb and chicken balls."
  
  Combine ground chicken, 1 Tbsp olive oil, egg, matza meal and 2 Tbsp broth
  in small bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix well. In large
  pot, place the lamb with remaining oil, sprinkle with 1 tsp salt and 1/4
  tsp pepper and lightly brown for 2-3 minutes. Add garlic, parsley and 1 cup
  of warm water. Form many tiny bowls with the ground chicken mixture and
  gently add to pot with lamb. Cover and simmer 1 to 1/2 hours. Add spinach
  and 1 Tsp salt and simmer, covered, 15 minutes longer. Transfer the lamb
  chops, half the spinach and most of the gravy to a hot serving dish and
  keep warm. Add remaining broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add matza pieces
  and cook 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and let stand 5 minutes before
  serving as a soup. Serve the lamb and spinach as the main dish. SERVES: 6-8

      2 ts Broth or;water

      1 ds Cinnamon or nutmeg
  2 1/2 qt Chicken broth
    1/2 c  Rice;uncooked
      8    Eggs, small;hard boiled
 
  Passover Chicken Soup with Rice      *matza meal is available at some
  supermarkets and Jewish grocery stores
  
  "I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the first
  two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our classic soup was a
  chicken soup with rice to which were added balls of chicken breast and
  whole immature eggs (which are still at the stage where the outer shell and
  white have not yet formed; they are perfectly round and vary from less than
  1" to less than 1 mm in diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with
  the white rice, the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens
  raised on private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
  eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.
  
  Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten egg
  with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add ground chicken,
  salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in the refrigerator for
  at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny balls, no larger than the
  egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add rice, chicken balls and cook,
  covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs, discard whites and place one hard
  boiled egg yolk in each of the eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg
  yolks and serve immediately.

     16    Halves of chicken breast
           -(order the chicken boned,
           - split, with the skin on)
 
  Saute the onions in butter until soft.  Combine with the other ingredients
  (except chicken) and mix well.  Season highly. Place each breast skin side
  up on a board.  Trim away excess fat.  Loosen skin from 1 side of breast
  and stuff approximately 1/3 cup of the filling under the skin. Tuck the
  skin and meat under breast, forming an even, round, dome shape. Put the
  stuffed breasts in a buttered Pyrex or metal baking dish. Fifteen minutes
  before baking, preheat over to 350 F (175 C).  Bake breasts until golden
  brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.  Don't overcook or chicken will be dry. Cool
  slightly before serving, and cool to room temperature if you are going to
  slice into smaller serving pieces.  Arrange on platters and decorate with
  fresh herbs.

  the skin of each breast, dredge each breast in flour and shake off the
  excess. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat on the stove. When
  the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), dip each breast in the beer batter
  and let the excess run off. Place skin-side down in the oil and fry until
  golden. Turn and fry other side, about 1 minute per side. Remove breasts
  from the oil as they are done, drain on paper towels and transfer to a
  baking dish. Place the chicken breasts in a preheated 375F oven for 15
  minutes. Place tomato sauce in a saucepan and reheat. (If the mixture is
  too thin, place it in a saucepan over high heat and boil down.) Pour the
  sauce onto a platter and arrange the chicken breasts on top.

  towel, cut lengthwise into thin julienne strips and set aside. In a 2-quart
  saucepan, combine the black beans with the sherry and cook for 1 minute
  over high heat. Add broth, garlic and ginger and bring almost to a boil.
  Reduce heat to low, add the chicken breasts, cover and simmer 4 minutes.
  Remove from heat and let the contents of the pan steep, covered, for 5
  minutes. Remove the chicken breasts to a plate and return the pan to the
  stove. Place over medium heat and cook uncovered for 5 minutes, reducing
  the liquid by 1/3. Pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, let cool for 10
  minutes, then transfer the mixture to a blender. Running the blender on
  medium, slowly add both oils. When it's time to put dinner on the table,
  pour the sauce onto a platter, and place a pile of snow peas in the center
  of the plate. Slice the chicken diagonally across the grain into thin
  strips. Fan chicken breasts around the snow peas. Arrange vegetables around
  the chicken and sprinkle with cilantro.

      2    Zucchini; cut into cubes
      1 tb Cilantro; fresh, chopped
           - fine
      1 c  Rice; cooked
    3/4 c  Chicken broth; or as needed
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
           Soy sauce; to taste
 
    Place chicken pieces in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and 2
  tablespoons soy sauce. stir to coat and let stand while preparing the
  remaining vegetables.
    Put the canola oil into a medium sized skillet (or wok). Saute the onions
  until they are limp.  Add the mushrooms and saute until they give up their
  juice. Remove the vegetables and reserve.
    Put the chicken and it's spices in the skillet, being careful to drain
  most of the liquid and cook until it it cooked through and slightly
  browned. Add the zucchini and cilantro, and stir fry 3 minutes. Add the
  rice, the reserved vegetables and enough of the chicken stock to keep the
  rice from sticking.
    Cook only briefly to allow everything to heat through. Add the almonds
  and serve immediately.
    Note:  This is a dish I often make when I have leftover rice, and I very
  often use up different cooked vegetables in this dish. With cooked
  vegetables, simply cut them into small cubes, or julienne and add them just
  early enough so that they will be well heated. Try not to use vegetables
  that will become mushy with the heating, you will want them to still be
  tender-crisp. We often use carrots, broccoli, even spinach. If you are
  having Denise Bradshaw over to dinner, throw in a few peas.

      6    Chicken breast halves,
           boned, skinned, and cut
           into 1/2" wide strips

--------------------------------PEANUT SAUCE--------------------------------
    2/3 c  Crunchy peanut butter
  1 1/2 c  Coconut milk, unsweetened
    1/4 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
      2 tb Soy sauce

      Title: CHICKEN BREASTS WITH GREEN CORIANDER (CILANTRO)
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Boneless chicken breasts
      1 bn Baby carrots
      1 bn Coriander (cilantro)
      2 tb Best quality olive oil
      1 ts Lemon juice
 
  Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.  Lay
  each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with the palm
  of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the sides of the
  paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible, and roll up to
  make a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with foil to make a
  waterproof package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.  Measure the olive oil
  into a small saucepan and add a seasoning of salt and pepper.  Coarsely
  chop a tablespoon or two of coriander leaves (a little less for beginners,
  a little more for addicts) and reserve separately.  All these preparations
  can be done well ahead.
      About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
  Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into a
  large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending on the
  size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the surface of the
  liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels, still wrapped up,
  to a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.
      Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.  Warm
  the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2 tablespoons of the
  juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly carve the breasts into
  thin slices and arrange the meat beside the carrots.  Add the lemon juice
  to the hot olive oil and immediately pour the sizzling mixture over the
  chicken and carrots.  Scatter with chopped coriander and serve straightway
  with hot crusty bread to mop up the juices.

  pink, stirring constantly.  Sprinkle sage, cumin and salt over chicken;

  leaf.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Cover and simmer 10 minutes.  Stir

      1 pk Chicken breasts or thighs,
           - boneless (approx 1lb.)
      1 tb Butter or margarine
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
    1/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Sliced mushrooms (opt.)

  some chili powder. When chicken is browned on both sides remove it to a
  plate. Put the cream of mushroom soup in the skillet, add teriyaki sauce
  and milk mixing until soup is smooth. Add more salt, pepper and chili
  powder to taste. Add mushrooms if desired, fresh or canned. Put cooked

  taste not to cover up the chicken but normally has a spicy, warm
  aftershock.

      Title: ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH CRANBERRY PORT SAUCE
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 12 servings
 
     12 ea Chicken breasts, boneless

----------------------------------STUFFING----------------------------------
      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
      3 ea Zucchini, grated and drained
      1 ts Tarragon, dried
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/4 c  Parsley, finely chopped
           Salt
           Pepper, fresh ground

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Port
      1 c  Red wine
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Cranberries, dried
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  To buy boneless chicken breasts with the skin on, purchase chicken breasts
  on the bone and ask your butcher or supermarket to remove the bones but
  leave the skin intact. It is a much more beautiful presentation and it
  keeps the chicken moist. Bones can be used to make stock or discarded. If
  you prefer, or can only obtain skinless chicken, then make a cut on the
  bottom of each breast the length of the breast to form a pocket. Stuff each
  breast with same amount of filling and turn slit side down. Brush top with
  a film of Dijon mustard and continue with recipe. To heighten mushroom
  flavour, add one 10g package of soaked dried mushrooms along with the
  regular mushrooms, if desired. Dried currents may be substituted for
  cranberries. Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Heat butter in skillet on
  medium high heat. Add onion, saute until softened the add mushrooms and
  zucchini. Saute until all liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally,
  about 10 minutes. Stir in tarragon and cream. Continue to cook until cream
  has reduced and mixture is thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and
  add enough breadcrumbs to hold mixture together. Add parsely and season
  well with salt and pepper. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper.
  With fingertips, make a pocket between skin and flesh of each chicken
  breast. Stuff about 1/3 c filling under skin, tucking skin around breast to
  enclose stuffing. Place chicken breasts in large oiled (preferably metal)
  baking dish or roasting pan. Dot with butter, refrigerate until one hour
  before baking. Baking in 400F (200C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until
  juices run clear. If skin is not quite crisp enough, place under broiler to
  crisp it. While chicken is baking, place sauce ingredients in pot and bring
  to boil over medium high heat. Reduce by half, skimming occasionally, about
  25 minutes. Over low heat, whisk in butter, 1 tb at a time, until sauce is
  slightly thickened and glossy. Just before serving, skim any fat off pan
  juices and add juices to sauce. Either slice chicken breasts into 1/4 inch
  slices before serving and coat with sauce or serve chicken breasts whole
  and place sauce in sauce boat. Garnish with extra dried cranberries, if
  desired.

      Title: PEANUT STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
 Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/8 c  Honey
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Mint, dried
      1 pk G. Washington's Golden
           -bouillon mix
 
  Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as
  possible. (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any
  knifework I've tried to date.)  Pull off shreds and gobbets.
  Put peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.
  Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to
  mix.
  Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over each
  piece of breast meat.  Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on the
  breast and roll them up into a packet.  Tie the packet shut with
  butcher's twine or fasten with a toothpick.
  Arrange the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful
  not to let any fall open.
  Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and mix
  well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets.
  Add water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch.
  Turn crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours.
  Remove packets from pot and let drain on a platter.
  All the chicken fat will have migrated to the top of the liquid,
  which I suspect would probably make a wonderful flavoring for soups
  and other dishes.

      Title: * CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Poultry, Breakfast, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Chicken breasts, split in
           - Half and boned
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
           Garlic powder to taste
      1 lb Smoked sausage or kielbasa
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Chopped onion (1 lg)
      1 c  Chopped pepper (1 lg)
      1 c  Chopped celery (2 ribs)
      7 c  Water divided
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Chopped garlic (1 clove)
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
    Season chicken breasts lightly with salt, black pepper and garlic powder.
  If possible, do this the day before you cook the gumbo.  Next slice sausage
  into 1/4-to-1/2 inch pieces.
  
    Make roux, using a cast iron or very heavy skillet that is very clean.
  Place oil in skillet over high heat - oil should be at stage where it just
  begins to smoke - and gradually stir in flour, using a long-handled spoon.
  
    Roux will take about 3 to 4 minutes to cook and must be stirred
  constantly so that it does not burn.  If you see black specks in the roux,
  it has burned and you must start over again.
  
    As you make the roux, it will change in color from cream to tan to brown
  and then to dark red-brown.  Remove from heat.  Stir in onions, green
  peppers and celery, stirring constantly until roux stops getting darker.
  Bring to stove once more, and cook over low heat about five to seven
  minutes, stirring constantly.
  
    In a large dutch oven, bring 6 c of water to a boil, and add the roux,
  stirring to dissolve it thoroughly.  Carefully add chicken and cook about
  30 to 40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.  Remove chicken, and
  set aside to cool.  Debone chicken, and cut into bite-size pieces.
  
    Add sausage, 1 c water, 1 ts black pepper and chopped garlic and cayenne
  to the pot, and simmer for 35 to 45 minutes, uncovered, stirring
  frequently.  Taste, and add salt, if necessary.  Stir in the chicken, and
  remove the gumbo from the heat.  skim surface to remove fat that sausage
  gives off during cooking.
  
    Serve over rice with a tossed salad and French bread.
  
    Note: Excellent.

      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Biscuits
    1/2 lb Chicken breast meat
           -- (boneless, skinless)
      3    Button mushrooms
      3    Shiitake mushrooms

  Have the biscuits ready to slip into the oven to bake as you begin to
  prepare the chicken.
  
  Cut the chicken into 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Slice the mushrooms, and if you
  are using shiitakes, discard the stems.  Heat the butter in a skillet; when
  it stops foaming, add the chicken and mushrooms and saute over moderate
  heat for 4 minutes.  Add the peppers and cook, stirring, over high heat for
  1 more minute.
  
  Pour the cream into the skillet and cook until it has reduced and
  thickened, about 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper.

  them with the creamed chicken.

  finding this recipe! It is probably called something else (like spicy fried
  chicken) and I really do have a dozen recipes.
  :)  This one is from _Elegant_ Entertaining_Cookbook_ by Myra Sable of
  Sable and Rosenfeld, Bantam books.
  
  General Tsao was a real person, general and poet who lived in China 155-220
  AD.
  
  rn e in the frig for 1 hour.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok. Deep fry the chicken, a few pieces at a time, about
  1 minute or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Pour all
  but 2 TB of the oil out of the wok.
  
  To the oil in the wok, add the chili peppers, garlic and ginger, stir-fry 2
  minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine and 1
  tea cornstarch, mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil and salt. Pour
  into wok, cook, stirring for 2 minutes until thickened.
  
  Return  chicken pieces to wok, mix well and serve.

      Title: CHINESE: CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPICY
 Categories: Main dish, Nuts, Chinese, Ethnic, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 c  Raw peanuts
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Whole chicken breasts at
           -room temp.
      1 lg Egg white
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
           SAUCE:
      4    Green onions
      2 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil
    1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 ts (level) chili paste with
           -garlic
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 pn Sugar
 
  cornstarch paste
  
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white part
  into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan.
  Reserve.
  
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat into
  1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold
  chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single
  chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk). Stir chicken pieces into egg
  mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut flour
  gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though the latter may be
  substituted.
  
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll
  need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry peanuts until they are a light tan
  color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts with
  strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.
  
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they are
  frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer. Add green onions &
  peanuts about a minute before serving. At the last minute, add chicken
  pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

  From "Catering by Michael's," as part of the menu for a cocktail reception
  for 100 guests held at a house on Lake Michigan and hosted by the head of
  an insurance company.  Published in Chicago Tribune Magaine 11/14/93.
  
  [Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see that
  nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices -- other
  than the chili powder (which was not listed in the "ingredients,"
  originally -- I had to go back and insert that)  or what to do with the
  vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices in the cooking oil and
  smear it over the chicken breast before grilling or broiling. Suggestions,
  of course, will be appreciated.  Complaints will be ignored.]

    For Dressing:  Combine all in blender.  Blend 15 seconds. Chill 4 hours
  or overnight.  Makes 1-2/3 cups dressing. 60 calories per tablespoon.
    Saute chicken in oil after marinating in soy sauce. Drain and chill 4
  hours or overnight.
    For Salad:  Combine spinach with 1 cup dressing or less if desired and
  toss.  Divide into 4 plates. Divide chicken, apple, peanuts, raisins and
  place on top of spinach. Serve immediately with additional dressing if
  desired.  Each serving :  525 calories.
    This dressing if very good and I have used it with other types of spinach
  salads and have also made it with low calorie syrup. The original recipe
  called for real maple syrup which makes the dressing extra special.
    Serve with a good crusty french bread.

      Title: AL'S CHICKEN SCHNITZEL
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      1 kg Chicken Breasts
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Flour
      2 c  Bread Crumbs(Krummies etc)
 
  All MEASUREMENTS and CURRENCY mentioned below in in METRIC and Australian
  currency. In 1 kg you usually get 3 breasts so cut them in half as
  described below and 2 halfs usually make a filling meal.Costs about $10 to
  serve a family since adult can have 2 halfs with mashed potato and mini
  carrots etc and children can have 1. This is my first Recipe so here goes.
  
  Cut Chicken Breasts down the middle into 2 parts. Use Spiked Mallet to beat
  chicken till its a mit thinner so it cooks better.Also trim any skin or get
  skinless breasts to reduce amount of calories.
  
  Get 3 plates.On the first plate sift flour on to plate. On second
  plate,beat eggs and pour onto a deep plate. On third put the bread crumbs
  on it.
  
  Dip or cover breasts in flour.Shake off excess.Coat breast with egg either
  by brushing on or dipping on plate.Then cover in bread crumbs and put on
  plate.
  
  On this is done you are ready to cook them.Now I usually cook mine so that
  the bread crumbs brown but dont get burnt so the schnitzel is very
  soft.Since I'm not an experienced cook but have to do the cooking for the
  family (Im 15) I dont know if Im undercooking them or what but they taste
  best that way.Just cook them and when the look cooked cut in half and if
  the meat is white(like chicken sould look not the colour of an uncooked
  fillet) they are cooked.I cook on medium heat in a frypan with some oil.
  Serving Suggestions: In the Colder months this meal is best served with
  Mashed potato and gravy as well as carrots and any other vegetables you
  like.
  
  In the Warm months my very favourite is a Schnitzel Burger. I put the
  lettuce on the bottom,Beetroot next,then the scnitzel,then a thin pineapple
  ring,and mayo.Excellent in summer months.2 of these make a filling and
  tasty meal.
  
  Well there you go.And comments and critisism would be appreciated. CYA!

      Title: GRILLED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH MANGO SALSA
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Chicken breast halves,
           -boneless
      2 T  Dark soy sauce
      2 T  Salad oil
      2 T  Honey
      2 T  Fresh, strained lime juice
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Cayenne pepper

--------------------------------MANGO SALSA--------------------------------
      2    Mangos (about 1 lb. each) **
    1/2 c  Finely diced red onion
    1/2 c  Cucumbers - see instructions
      2    Peppers, seeded and diced
           Juice of two limes
    1/2 t  Salt

---------------------------BASIC-CAPER MAYONNAISE---------------------------
      2    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 T  Strained fresh lime juice
    1/4 t  SALT, HEAPING
 
  Cucumbers should be finely dice, unpeeled.-
  
  Trim the chicken breast halves of all fat and gristle and separate the
  tenderloin.  Mix soy, oil, honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a
  shallow dish just large enough to hold the chicken in one close layer.
  Marinate the chicken in this mixture for 1 hour at room temperature or for
  several hours the refrigerator, turning several times.  Grill the chicken
  breasts for 3 to 4 minutes per side, the tenderloins about 2 minutes per
  side.  The chicken may also be sauteed over moderate heat in a skillet
  lightly filmed with oil.  The bottom of the skillet will darken as the
  honey caramelizes but is easily cleaned.
  
  Cut the breasts in thick slices and fan on dinner plates, placing the
  tenderloins along side.  Spoon the salsa over the top and drizzle with the
  mayonnaise.
  
  MANGO SALSA
  
  Slice the mango flesh from each side of the pit.  One half at a time, make
  an inch cut just inside the skin, then score the flesh in 3/8-inch cubes.
  Turn skin inside out and free the mango flesh with the knife. Cut the cubes
  in inch dice, reserving any mushy pieces for some other use. You should end
  up with about 1 1/2 cups. Combine mango with all remaining ingredients and
  let sit 30 minutes to blend flavor.
  
  **  Note:  1 1/2 Cups peach or papaya dice may be substituted for the
  mango.

     10 tb Red chile,mild,ground
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Oregano,dried,pref. Mexican
    1/2 ts Cumin
           Rosemary
  1 1/2 c  Tomatoes,Italian-style
     16 oz Tomato sauce
      8 oz Tomato sauce,Mexican hot
      1 cn Chiles,green,mild,whole
      1 cn Jalapeno peppers,pickled
      2 tb Hot pepper sauce,liquid
      1 tb Butter
      3    Chiles,fresh whole green
    1/2 c  Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Sauterne
     12 oz Beer
 
  1. In a large non-aluminum (preferably glass or glazed cast iron)
     bowl make a marinade by combining the burgundy, thyme, bay leaves,
     garlic, and black pepper. Place all the beef in the bowl and mix
     lightly to coat the meat well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
     (If time is short marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.)
  
  2. Place the chicken breasts in a saucepan with enough water to
     cover. Add 1 teaspoon salt and simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour.
     Remove the chicken reserving the liquid. Chop the chicken breasts
     fine and reserve.
  
  3. Meal the oil in a large heavy pot. Add the onions and cook until
     they are translucent.
  
  4. Meanwhile, drain the beef, straining and reserving the marinade.
     Mix the beef and pork together, then combine the meats with the
     ground chile, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, rosemary, and the
     rest of the salt.  Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with
     the onions. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring
     occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned.
  
  5. Add half the marinade, the reserved chicken, tomatoes, both tomato
     sauces, jalapenos, and 1 tablespoon of liquid hot pepper sauce to
     the pot.
  
  6. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the fresh
     chiles, mushrooms, and a small amount of the Sauterne and cook for
     3 minutes. Add this to the pot.
  
  7. Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for at least 3 hours. When
     the chili is cooking, from time to time stir in the remaining
     marinade, the remaining Sauterne, and beer. If more liquid is
     needed, stir in the water the chicken was cooked in. Taste and
     adjust seasonings.

      Title: TOM KHA GAI (CHICKEN COCONUT SOUP)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Coconut milk
      6    Thin slices young galangal
      2    Stalks lemon grass,
           ; lower third portion only,
           ; cut into 1" piece, crushed
      5    Fresh kaffir lime leaves
      8 oz Boned chicken breast, sliced
      5 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Lime juice
      1 ts Black chili paste
    1/4 c  Cilantro/coriander leaves
           ; torn
      5    Green Thai chili peppers,
           ; crushed
 
  A rich, aromatic dinner soup, which is enjoyed throughout the meal.
  Whenever possible, fresh kaffir lime leaves should be used, and their
  flavor and aroma is increased when they are torn instead of cut with a
  knife.  Young galangal is pale yellow, with firm unwrinkled pink shoots.
  Fresh young ginger can be substituted if necessary, but the flavor will not
  be quite the same.
  
  Combine half the coconut milk with the galangal, lemon grass and lime
  leaves in a large saucepan and heat to boiling.  Add the chicken, fish
  sauce and sugar.
  
  Simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked .  Add the
  remaining coconut milk to the saucepan and heat just to boiling.
  
  Place the lime juice and chili past in a serving bowl, then pour the soup
  into the serving bowl.
  
  Garnish with the torn cilantro leaves and crushed chili peppers, and serve.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place
  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and
  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole
  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the
  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to
  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and
  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.
  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for
  garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper
  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,
  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds. We also served it
  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who
  cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any
  tender, delicate white fish ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or
  maybe little chunks of monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as
  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I
  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,
  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available
  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or
  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok
  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild. I like it
  in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,
  I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the
  slices of lemon grass and ginger.

      Title: SMOKED CHICKEN AND PEPPERONI GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Chicken
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           -Spice mixture:
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 ts Red pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 ts Dry parsley flakes
    1/2 ts Gumbo file powder
           -(optional)
           -Vegetables:
      2 c  Onion
      2 c  Green pepper
      2 c  Celery
           -meats:
      2    Smoked chicken breasts.
     12    Inches pepperoni.
           -broth:
      6 c  Chicken broth
 
  Prepare vegetables. Cut half in larger hunks (say 1/2 inch) and cut rest in
  fine chop (or use food processor).
  
  Meats: two smoked chicken breasts, pulled from bone, skinned and pulled
  into bite size pieces by hand.  If you do not have smoked chicken, you may
  get away with using a small amount of liquid smoke. I would guess no more
  than 1/4 teaspoon. one stick (about 12 inches) pepperoni, cut into
  moderately thick slices. (say 1/8 inch or about twice as thick as presliced
  pizza pepperoni usually is)
  
  Preparation: Using cast iron dutch oven, take the large cut onions and
  singe them over medium high heat in the dry pan for about 3-4 minutes,
  stirring constantly. Then add the rest of the vegetables and cook for about
  5 minutes more on medium heat, stirring frequently. Then add spice mixture
  and stir to incorporate. Stir in about 2 tablespoon dry roux. Add the broth
  and the pepperoni slices. Turn heat down to medium low and simmer for at
  least 1/2 hour or until vegetables are tender and flavors are merged. About
  5 minutes before serving, add the chunks of chicken breasts to the mixture.
  At the same time, add more roux to thicken if desired.
  
  Serve in bowl over lots of rice.
  
  For additional smoke flavor, wrap the chicken bones and skin in cheese
  cloth and place in the mixture at the same time as the pepperoni. Remove
  all the bones and all the skin before stirring in the chicken pieces.
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

  coat well. Marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour.
  
   In a small bowl, combine remaining soy sauce, vinegar, white wine, and 1
  tsp. cornstarch; mix until smooth. Stir in sugar, sesame oil and salt.
  
   In a wok heat oil. Deep-fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, about 1
  minute, or until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towel. Pour all
  but 2 tbls. oil out of wok. To the wok, add chili peppers, garlic and
  ginger; stir-fry 1 minute.

  chicken is spicy hot with the dried chili peppers, so adjust to your taste.
  Enjoy!

-------------------------------JUDI M. PHELPS-------------------------------
      1 lb Boneless, chicken breasts;
           -skinless and trimmed of all
           -fat
    1/2 ts Salt; optional
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 ts Tub-style margarine; canola
           -or corn oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      1 cl Garlic; minced
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth; defatted and
           -divided
      2 T  Mild honey
      2 T  Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt; or to taste optional
  1 1/2 c  Cauliflower florets
      1 lg Carrot; peeled and thinly
           -sliced
    1/4 c  ;water
      1 T  Cornstarch
      2 T  Dijon-style mustard
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain white rice
           -uncooked
 
  Cut chicken into small bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt,
  if desired, and pepper.  In large nonstick, spray- coated skillet, cook
  chicken pieces over medium heat, turning frequently with large wooden or
  plastic spoon, 7-10 minutes or until they begin to brown and are cooked
  through.  Remove and set aside in medium bowl. In same skillet, combine
  margarine, onion, garlic, and 3 tablespoons broth. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring frequently, 6-7 minutes or until onion is tender. If liquid begins
  to evaporate, add a bit more broth. Add honey and lemon juice to pan with
  onions, and stir to combine well. Stir in remaining chicken broth and salt,
  if desired.  Stir in reserved chicken, cauliflower, and carrot. Bring to a
  boil.  Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 20 minutes or until flavors are
  blended.  Meanwhile, cook rice according to package directions.
  
  Combine water and cornstarch.  Stir into simmering sauce and cook,
  stirring, until thickened.  Stir in mustard.  Simmer an additional 1 or 2
  minutes.  Arrange rice on large serving platter.  Top with chicken and
  sauce.  Or serve individual portions over rice.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I have not tried this dish but cooking cauliflower for 20
  minutes is just too long.  I would advise 10 minutes tops to keep it's
  bright color and not become mushy.

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 T  Sweet butter
      2 T  Chopped scallions
    1/2 lb Button mushrooms, whole
           -or quartered large ones
           -wiped, stems removed
           Salt
           Freshly ground white
           -pepper
      6    Prepared chicken breasts
           -with skin removed,
           -slightly flattened
    1/2 c  Concentrated chicken
           -stock*
      1 ds Lemon juice
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1    Beurre Manie*
      2 T  Finely chopped chives
 
  * Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  These butter-flour balls can be
  made ahead in advance and stored in a sealed jar in the refrigerator for 1
  or 2 weeks.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T sweet butter on a small flat plate
  and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth paste. Roll the paste
  into a ball. In a small skillet, heat 2 T of butter. Add the scallions and
  cook for 2 or 3 minutes without browning.  Add the mushrooms. Season with
  salt and pepper and cook the mixture over high heat for 2 or 3 more minutes
  to brown the mushrooms lightly. Reserve. Season the chicken breasts with
  salt and pepper and sprinkle them with lemon juice. In a large chicken
  fryer, melt the remaining butter. When it is quite hot, add the chicken
  breasts and cook them for 1 minute on each side.  Cover the pan with
  buttered wax paper and then the pan lid.  Lower the heat and simmer the
  chicken breasts for another 8 to 10 minutes or until the juices run out
  pale yellow when pierced with a fork. Do not overcook or pierce every
  piece.  Immediately remove the chicken breasts to a serving platter. Pour
  the chicken stock into the fryer, raise the heat and reduce the stock until
  it is almost a glaze. Add the heavy cream and continue cooking over high
  heat.  Add the Beurre Manie and cook until the sauce heavily coats a spoon.
  Add the chives and correct the seasoning. Add the mushroom & scallion
  mixture.  Add the chives and correct the seasoning. Pour the sauce over the
  chicken breasts and serve at once. From "Season Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

    1/2 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
    1/2 t  Beef-flavor instant
           -bouillon
 
  *Guava paste is available in Mexican & Spanish groceries.  If
  you cannot find it, you can substitute the same amount of
  jellied cranberry sauce. Place one chicken breast half between
  2 pieces of plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Working from center,
  gently pound chicken with rolling pin or flat side of meat mallet
  until about 1/4" thick. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.
  In small bowl, combine salt, oregano, pepper and garlic; mix well.
  Sprinkle evenly over chicken breasts.  Form guava paste into four
  2 x 1/2 x 1/2" strips and place one on each ham slice.  Spoon
  about a tablespoonful of cilantro over each strip of guava paste.
  Fold ham around guava and cilantro to form a foll.  Place one roll
  on narrow end of each chicken half; roll up, jelly-roll fashion.
  Secure with toothpicks.  Heat 1 T oil in skillet over medium heat;
  add chicken rolls, seam side down.  Cook covered for 6 minutes or
  until no longer pink, turning once halfway through cooking.  Remove
  toothpicks.  Place chicken on paper towels; pat dry.  Heat oven to
  375 degrees.  Separate dough into 4 rectangles; firmly press
  perforations to seal.  Place one chicken roll on each rectangle.
  Fold dough over chicken; press edges to seal.  Place, seam side
  down, on ungreased cookie sheet.  Cut slits in tops to allow steam
  to escape.  Bake for 13 to 18 minutes or until golden brown.
  Meanwhile, in small saucepan over low heat, combine all sauce
  ingredients; cook and stir until guava paste melts.  Simmer until
  sauce thickens. Place chicken bundles on serving plates; top with
  sauce. Garnish with additional cilantro, if desired.  Serve
  immediately. (2/3 cup sauce)

  moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes if uncovered, 35 minutes if covered.
  Serve warm with a good green salad.
  For a more 20th century flavor-- double the chicken, leave out the pigeon,

  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
           SAUCE:
      4    Green onions
      2 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil

  color;
  if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts with
  strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve.
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first:  chicken should
  raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at a
  time.  Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while they
  are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon.  Reserve.
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions
  & peanuts about a minute before serving.  At the last minute, add chicken

  Midnight supper, perhaps for New Year's Eve or after the show, can be
  exotic in a hurry. The foods are sliced ahead, the sauces made, then all
  stowed in the refrigerator. When guests are hungry, the hostess simply
  heats the broth and sets out the makings.
  
  Genghis Khan hot pot is another name for this Chinese specialty. Or maybe
  you've seen it on restaurant menus as volcano soup. We show an
  honest-to-goodness Mongolian cooker with a charcoal chimney in the center,
  but any chafing dish or electric skillet will do as well.
  
  What's cooking. Everything on the tray is raw, of course--chunks of
  eggplant, crosscut strips of sirloin, halved mushrooms, thin slices of
  chicken breast, squares of Chinese cabbage, shucked shrimp. Fresh spinach
  to simmer along with the other foods is ready in the big red bowl. The
  broth is chicken bouillon that boasts a faint overtone of ginger.
  Individual bowls of fluffy rice are served at the same time as Hot Pot.
  
  The how-to. You pick out a few choice tidbits at a time and drop them from
  chopsticks, bamboo tongs, or fork into the lazily bubbling broth. In a few
  minutes, fish them out to dip into zesty sauces on your plate, like Peanut
  or Red Sauce, Chinese Mustard or Ginger Soy.
  
  Traditionalists poach eggs in the broth when it has taken on subtle flavor
  from the foods that have simmered in it. At the very last, the hostess may
  ladle the broth as a soup. It's delicious! Dessert? Skip it, or serve a
  fruit bowl and candied ginger with coffee or tea.
  
  Etiquette: Use one set of chopsticks for cooking and fishing out morsels
  from Hot Pot, use a second set for eating. If only one set is provided for
  each guest, simply reverse your chopsticks (large ends down) when you cook
  or help yourself to food.
  
  Oriental Hot Pot
  
  Chinese Mustard Ginger Soy Peanut Sauce Red Sauce Hot cooked rice
  
  Shortly before cooking time arrange the meats and vegetables on large tray
  or platter; use a bowl for spinach. Set out dunking sauces. Provide Bamboo
  tongs, chopsticks or long-handled forks as cooking tools for guests.
  
  Heat chicken broth in electric skillet or chafing dish (or use Mongolian
  cooker-- directions follow). Add bouillon cubes to hot broth and stir to
  dissolve; add monosodium glutamate and ginger. Heat to simmering. For
  cooking have broth barely bubbling. Each Guest picks up desired foods with
  chopsticks or whatever, drops them into the bubbling broth. When his
  tidbits are cooked, he lifts them out and dips into the sauces on his
  plate. Serve with rice. Makes 4 servings.
  
  To use Mongolian cooker, fill chimney of cooker with charcoal and add
  charcoal starter. Pour cold chicken broth into cooker. Cover cooker, then
  light charcoal. When broth is hot, continue as above.

    1/2 c  Fish stock or chicken broth
      1 lb Small shrimp
      2 c  Whipping cream
    3/4 lb Butter
 
  ROAST PEPPERS:  Place poblano peppers under the broiler and char on all
  sides. Put in plastic bag and freeze 10 minutes. Remove from freezer, rub
  off peel, then slit to remove seeds under running water.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  In a medium saute pan, saute onion, shrimp,
  and cilantro until the shrimp are almost cooked, about 5 minutes.  Place in
  mixture in a bowl, add the cheese and set aside.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:  Lay the four prepared chicken breasts flat, skin-side down.
  Season with salt and white pepper.  Layer each breast with one pepper and 2
  to 3 tablespoons shrimp/cheese mixture over pepper. Roll each breast
  tightly to form a cylinder. Tie each cylinder in 3 places, both ends and in
  the middle.
  
  In a skillet, heat about 1/4-inch of oil.  Lightly brown chicken breasts,
  one at a time, on all sides. Remove from heat, transfer to a oven-proof
  dish and bake for 10 minutes until golden brown.
  
  Remove from oven.  Cut strings and slice chicken into 1-inch roulades
  (rounds).  Drizzle a few tablespoons of Creamy Shrimp Sauce onto a plate
  and arrange the roulades on top of the sauce. Serve warm. Makes 4 servings.
  
  TO MAKE CREAMY SHRIMP SAUCE:  In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine
  shallots and wine.  Cook until reduced by three-fourths.  Add stock/broth
  and shrimp and cook until reduced by half. Add the cream and reduce again
  by half. Whisk in the butter by tablespoons. Cook until butter melts and
  sauce is well-blended. Remove from heat. Recipe: Cafe Noche, 2409 Montrose

  Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark Chicken Da Vinci Saute Italian
  Sausage slices until done, remove from pan. In the grease from the
  sausages, with olive oil added as necessary, saute the garlic and green
  peppers. When peppers are about 1/2 done, add the onion. Cook until veggies
  are barely tender, still a trifle crisp, but not browned. Remove from pan
  and add to sausages. Add more oil, saute mushrooms until browned, remove
  and add to rest of the stuff. Last step, saute the chicken until done. Add
  everything else back into the pan, season generously with rosemary and
  oregano. Throwing a little basil in won't hurt it either. If the dish seems
  dry, add small amounts of either plain chicken broth or a broth & white
  wine mix. If you've added too much liquid, then thicken it with cornstarch.

     15    Basil leaves
      1 c  Chopped cabbage
 
  Thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  (If doing veggie version, cut
  vegetables into thin strips.) Grind together red chili peppers, lemon
  grass, and kaffir lime leaves in a food processor or pound in a mortar.
  Heat oil to medium-high and saute pepper mixture for 3 minutes.  Stir in
  coconut milk and cook for 2 minutes.  Add chicken (or vegetables) and cook
  for 5 minutes or until cooked (same time for veggies).  Reduce heat to
  medium-low.  Stir in fish sauce (if using), salt, and basil.  Serve on a

  Note: ===== For mixed vegetables, choose from among bell peppers, string
  beans, water chestnuts, tomatoes (small cherry tomatoes are best), bamboo
  shoots, miniature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini, Japanese eggplant,
  and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans or asparagus, a few cherry
  tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced) bamboo shoots, miniature corn, and
  some straw mushrooms or slender (Japanese) eggplant.

           -OR- sliced green onions
 
  Combine the vinegar, water, fish sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and dried
  shrimp in a small bowl; mix until well blended and reserve.  In a large
  pot, soak the noodles in enough water to cover.  In a small skillet or pot,
  heat vegetable oil 3/4 to 1 inch deep to 350 degrees, or until a dried rice
  noodle puffs instantly when dropped into the oil.  Deep-fry the basil
  leaves a few at a time, turning them once or twice until they are crisp, or
  40 seconds to a minute; drain on paper toweling.
  
  Bring the noodles to a boil and cook them 2 minutes, or until they are
  almost tender.  Drain and rinse them well, then spread them on paper
  toweling to dry slightly.  Head a wok or large skillet and add about 2 1/2
  tablespoons vegetable oil.  Fry the Serrano peppers about 30 seconds, then
  add the garlic and stir-fry until it is soft.  Add the chicken or pork and
  stir-fry until the chicken is almost opaque throughout or the pork is
  browned.  Stir in the shrimp and the sauce and mix completely. Make a well
  in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs. When they are almost
  set, scramble them evenly.  Add half the noodles, throughly incorporating
  them into the mixture; stir in the remaining noodles and half the bean
  sprouts.  Cook just until the bean sprouts are nearly wilted.
  
  Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter.  Cover one half of them with
  ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts.  Ring the
  noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and garnish the
  top with the fried basil.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP (TOM KA GAI OR KAI TOM GA
 Categories: Soups/stews, Thai, Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan, place
  the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and
  (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole
  dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the
  hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir to
  distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil and
  cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished cooking.
  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro leaves for
  garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh grouper
  instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of the ginger,
  and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds.  We also served it
  over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who
  cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper, it'd be good with any
  tender, delicate white fish -- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or
  maybe little chunks of monkfish.  I believe I've had this with shrimp as
  well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I
  recall, in other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white,
  very tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available
  in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin or
  the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from Bangkok
  for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild.  I like
  it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient demand,
  I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat around the
  slices of lemon grass and ginger.

    1/2 c  Onion; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Garlic; chopped
 
  In large pot, boil chicken in water to cover until tender; reserve 2 cups
  broth.  Debone and dice chicken.  Add chicken, tomatoes, onion, salt and
  garlic to reserved broth; boil 10 minutes or until reduced enough for
  enchilada filling.  Strain. Heat a bit of oil in a small skillet; press
  each tortillas into the hot oil a few seconds to soften them and make them
  more pliable to roll. Stuff with chicken filling. Roll filled tortillas and
  place in baking dish. Cover one-third of the enchiladas (longways) with
  salsa verde, the center third with the sour cream, and the final third with
  salsa colorado.  The result should resemble the Mexican flag. Bake at 375
  degrees until thoroughly heated, about 25 minutes.
  
  Salsa colorado:  Wash chiles, stem and seed. Cook in boiling water to cover
  well 10 mins. or until soft. Remove and drain. Reserve liquid. Place chiles
  in blender with reserved water, and whirl until you achieve a pasty
  consistency. Heat oil in large skillet. Add garlic and flour and cook,
  stirring until flour browns. Add chile paste slowly to mix well with flour
  to a smooth paste. When all the chile paste is added, bring to a boil,
  stirring constantly. Cook until it thickens, 3-4 minutes. Thin with water
  to a thick, saucy consistency.
  
  Salsa verde:  Boil tomatillos in small amount of water until tender; blend
  in food processor. In skillet, saute onions in oil. Add pureed tomatillos,
  salt and garlic.

      Title: SAVORY CHICKEN
 Categories: Mexican, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Or 4 half chicken breasts,
           -boned and skinned,
           Cut into pieces
 
  Savory Chicken is so fast and so good you will just want to stand and eat
  it out of the pan.
  
  (Home Spice Blend: use approximately the measurements below for spices. For
  the spice blend, combine cumin, cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic and onion
  powders, salt and flour.  Increase the spice amounts if you are cooking
  more than 2 1/2 pounds of chicken.)
  
  1  tsp cumin powder 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp crushed thyme 1/2 tsp
  garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp salt 1 Tbs flour 2 Tbs butter 1
  or 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 or 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded, minced 1/2 cup
  to 3/4 cup light beer This recipe doubles easily but don't try to saute the
  chicken all at once. After the chicken is skinned and boned, rub it with
  your home spice blend.  If you get inspired, add another spice. Let the
  spiced chicken sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
  
  Using a heavy 12-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil and add 1 cup of the
  chicken pieces at a time.  Saute over medium heat until golden. Remove to a
  plate.  Saute the rest of the chicken, adding more oil if necessary. When
  all the chicken is sauteed, drain off any excess oil. Put all the chicken
  pieces back in the pan, along with the chiles and garlic and add the beer.
  A great head of steam will rise up the the most wonderful aroma. Quickly
  now, clamp on the lid and turn the heat to low.  Check every 5 minutes and
  turn the chicken in the reducing broth.  Cook for about 15 to 18 minutes.
  If the broth cooks away toward the end of the cooking, just add a
  tablespoon more beer.  At the end you should be left with a nice thick
  glaze.  Push the chicken around the beer glaze so it all gets coated. This
  is about the best taco meat you will ever encounter. Since tacos are filled
  with other things, the recipe above will serve 4 people unless you ate too
  much out of the pan.

      1 tb Chopped parsley
 
  Servings: 4 Notes: "I name this recipe for the beautiful and fascinating
  Cleopatra. I would have liked to serve this dish to her as she sailed down
  the Nile on her barge to "caper" with Anthony."
  
  DIRECTIONS: Heat the oil and butter in a large frypan. Dredge the chicken
  in the flour and saute for 3 minutes on each side. Add the green onions,
  tarragon, capers and cook for 5 more minutes. Pour in the wine, stock,
  brandy and cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
  Serve over rice or pasta with chopped parsley on top. (My notes: after
  adding & cooking the green onions, etc, remove the chicken from the pan.
  Add the brandy first, and simmer until reduced by about half. Then add the
  wine and beef stock and reduce slightly. Add the cream and return the
  chicken to the pan- simmering 5 minutes as above.)

      1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
    1/2 c  Fresh Parmesan; grated
 
  Earlier in the day, add enough water to the skinned chicken to cover it.
  Poach chicken in simmering water (uncovered) until chicken is no longer
  pink. This will take about 8 minutes. Allow chicken to cool in poaching
  liquid. (I put it in the refrig. rather than leave it at room temp. Cooling
  it in the liquid makes it more tender) Later, remove chicken from poaching
  liquid and chop it into small or bite-size pieces. Save the poaching liquid
  to add to the water you're going to cook the pasta in. In large non-stick
  pan, cook the onion and garlic in heated olive oil until softened. Add hot
  pepper flakes and tomatoes and juice. Cook about 30 minutes over med. heat
  until sauce thickens. Cook penne in poaching liquid with additional water
  as needed. Combine chicken with the sauce mixture in serving bowl. Add
  parsley and cheese. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately. Judy

      4 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 lb Medium shrimp, shelled and
           -deveined
      1    Boneless chicken breast
           -half, skinned, thinly
           -sliced
      3    Garlic cloves, minced
      3 tb Yellow bean sauce
      3 tb Tomato paste
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1    To 2 tablespoons distilled
           -vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      3    Eggs
      2 tb Chopped preserved radish,
           -soaked in warm water for
     10    Minutes, drained (optional)
      1 tb Small dried shrimp
           -(optional)
      1    Inch cubes fried tofu, cut
           -into 1/2-inch slices
           -(optional)
           Big pinch chile flakes
      2    Handfuls bean sprouts,
           -tailed
      2    To 4 tablespoons chicken
           -broth or water, as needed
      4    Green onions, trimmed, cut
           -into 2-inch lengths
           GARNISHES:
      2 tb Coarsely chopped roasted
           -peanuts
           Chile flakes
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
      2    Limes, cut into wedges
 
  Place noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water; let soak about 15
  minutes, or until soft and pliable. Drain; set aside.
  
  Set a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.
  Add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry until shrimp turns bright orange and
  chicken turns white, about 30 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Reheat wok over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and the garlic; brown
  gently (about 20 seconds). Increase heat to medium- high. Add the bean
  sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar; stir until sugar
  dissolves.
  
  Increase heat to high. Break 1 of the eggs into the sauce; beat 3 or 4
  times. Let cook until egg is slightly set but still moist, about 20
  seconds. Repeat with second and third egg. There should be tiny flecks of
  egg peeking through.
  
  Add the optional radish, dried shrimp and tofu, the chile flakes, softened
  noodles and 1 handful of bean sprouts to the hot wok. Toss and lift noodles
  until tender and no longer stiff, about 3 or 4 minutes.
  
  Add the chicken broth 2 tablespoons at a time if noodles seem dry, the
  green onions and the reserved shrimp/chicken mixture; toss for 30 seconds
  to reheat. The sauce is not a wet sauce; it should "dry-coat" the noodles.
  
  Transfer to a platter and serve with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts, chile
  flakes to taste and fresh coriander leaves. Arrange. remaining bean sprouts
  and lime wedges around noodles. (Squeeze lime over noodles before eating.)
  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Note: Traditionally, Pad Thai uses dried, flat Y4-inch-wide fettuccine-like
  rice-flour noodles, labeled "Chantaboon rice sticks."

      1 tb Light soy sauce, or more if
           -needed
      4 tb Chicken stock, or more if

  In this popular Cantonese teahouse specialty, the rice noodles are
  permeated with an aromatic infusion of curry spices and herbs, seasonings
  borrowed from Indian and Malay cooking-- both cuisines are indigenous to
  Singapore.
  
  Cover mushrooms with warm water. When soft and pliable, remove and squeeze
  dry. Cut off and discard stems. Cut caps into thin slices.
  
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles; using chopsticks, stir
  and loosen noodles. When soft and pliable, about 30 seconds, drain them
  into a colander. Cover and let cool.
  
  Preheat wok until hot. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, 1 slice of the ginger,
  the chicken, shrimp and pork; stir-fry until shrimp and chicken feel firm
  to the touch, about 1 minute. Remove and set aside. Pick out and discard
  ginger.
  
  To hot wok add remaining oil, ginger and salt, crushing ginger against
  sides of wok. When oil is hot, toss in onions, celery, snow peas,
  mushrooms, bell pepper and green onion; stir- fry until tender and crisp (1
  to 2 minutes). Push vegetables to side of wok. Add curry powder to center
  of wok and lightly saute for 10 seconds. Then add sugar, soy sauce and
  chicken stock. Mix.
  
  Add noodles; combine,with vegetables by using chopsticks, to lift, shake
  and separate strands of noodles, until they are evenly coated with sauce,
  moist but not wet and begin to cling to each other. (Add more chicken stock
  if noodles seem too dry). Return meat mix mixture, taste for seasoning.
  Toss to heat through.

      Title: STEAMED BREAST OF CHICKEN WITH BLACK MUSHROOM
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lg Chicken breast
      8    Dried Nami black mushrooms
      2    Green onions
      8    Water chestnuts
      1    Chinese sausage (opt)

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      2 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2    Slices ginger root/minced
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Thin soy sauce
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  Preparation:  Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 1/2 hour or until soft.
  Remove stems; thinly slice caps. Debone chicken; slice into 1/2" thick,
  quarter-size coins; place pieces in shallow, heat-proof dish. Add marinade
  ingredients to chicken; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Slice water
  chestnuts in thin circles.  Cut green onions on bias into 1" sections.
  
  There are 2 varieties of "Cantonese-style" Chinese semi-dried sausage
  available in Chinese markets: duck liver & sweet pork meat. Either will do
  for this dish. Cut sausage on bias into 1/8" thick slices. Marinade is not
  used with sausage.
  
  Steaming:  Mix sliced mushrooms & water chestnuts with chicken. If desired,
  add sausage. Steam for 20 minutes. If using deep bowl, stir chicken after
  10 minutes to make certain bottom pieces get cooked. Just before serving,
  add green onions. Serve immediately, since cornstarch will become gummy if
  dish is allowed to cool.
  
  HINT: If using metal steamer, stretch dish towel under steamer cover, to
  prevent build-up of condensed steam in dish.

      Title: CHEESE FONDUE, AMERICAN STYLE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           ****FONDUE****
      4 cn Campbell's Cheddar cheese
           Soup, undiluted
      1 lb Cheddar cheese sharp, grated
      5 x  Cloves fresh garlic
           Or 1tbsp. garlic powder
      2 tb Kirsch or cherry brandy
           ****DIPPERS****
           FRENCH BREAD
           Ham
           Shrimp
           Smokie links
           Cocktail wieners
           ****DIPPERS****
           Hot dogs
           Smoked sausage
           Turkey, chicken breast
           Turkey ham
           Broccoli
           Cauliflower
           Carrots
           Mushrooms
           Brussel sprouts
           Cherry tomatoes
           Celery stalk
           Radishes
 
  Heat cheese soup in fondue pot or heavy skillet on low. Slowly add
  grated cheddar cheese, Kirsch, and garlic (for best results use
  freshly pressed) If mixture looks too thin, add 2 or 3 tb flour to a
  small amt. of cold milk, stir until smooth, and slowly add to pot
  while stirring.
  FRENCH BREAD: get the baguettes if available in your area, if not,
  any type will have to do. Be sure to heat it in oven at 350 degrees
  for about 10 minutes, then cut it into bite sized pieces. It's best
  when crusty.
  MEAT DIPPERS: (heat and cut into bite sized pieces any or all of
  these). Ham, shrimp, smokie links, cocktail wieners, smoked sausage,
  turkey breast, chicken breast, turkey ham, hot dogs.
  VEGETABLE DIPPERS : (slightly cooked ...do not overcook, or else the
  pieces will slip off the fondue fork and get "lost" in the pot.... or
  raw), cut into bite sized pieces Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots,
  mushrooms, Brussel Sprouts, cherry tomatoes, celery stalk, radishes.
  VARIATION: Instead of cheddar cheese soup use Campbell's Nacho cheese
  dip (soup) in cans, and substitute part or all of it for regular
  cheddar cheese soup, or add some finely chopped jalapeo peppers to
  the cheese mixture for extra zest.
  SPECIAL HINTS: Serve to company (it's always a hit!) on a cold fall
  day for lunch, or a freezing winter's night, or warm their hearts
  during a gentle spring rain. Best if served accompanied by champagne
  or wine. Best mood is created if candles are lit and a fire is
  blazing in the fireplace.
  Sit fondue pot with fondue in the middle of the table, pot on low
  heat. Place dippers in individual bowls. Each guest gets a fondue
  fork and first spears a dipper with it, then dips it into the cheese
  sauce, twirl it around slowly and balance into mouth. Very addictive,
  so be careful. (Renate's own recipe developed and perfected over many
  years). Enjoy!

      Title: EVIL JUNGLE PRINCE WITH CHICKEN (OR MIXED VEGETABLES)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Boneless chicken breast or:
    1/2 lb Mixed vegetables
      4    Small red chile peppers
    1/2    Stalk lemon grass
      2    Kaffir lime leaves
      2 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Coconut milk
      2 tb Fish sauce
     15    Basil leaves
      1 c  Chopped cabbage
 
  thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  If doing veggie version, cut

  and kaffir lime leaves.  Heat oil and saute pepper mixture for three
  minutes.  Stir in coconut milk and cook for two minutes.  Add chichen (or
  vegetables) and cook for five minutes of until cooked.  Reduce heat to

  Note:  For mixed vegetables, choose from amoung bell peppers, string
  beands, water chestnuts, tomatoes ( small cherry tomatoes are best), bamboo
  shoots, nimiature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini, Japanese eggplant,
  and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans or asparagus, a few cherry
  tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced) bamboo shoots, miniature corn, and
  stome straw mushrooms or slender (Japanese) eggplant.

      Title: GAENG KIOW WAHN GAI (GREEN CHICKEN CURRY)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Chicken Breast
      2    Chicken Thighs
    1/2 c  Coconut Cream
    1/4 c  Green Curry Paste
      3 c  Coconut Milk
  1 1/2 c  Diced Eggplant
      2 tb Fish Sauce
      1 tb Palm or Brown Sugar
    1/2 ts Coriander leaves
    1/2 c  Basil leaves
      3    Red chilis
 
  1. Bone and skin the chicken breast and thighs, you should have about
     1lb of meat. Cut the meat into large, bite sized pieces, and set
     aside.
  
  2. In a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan, warm the coconut cream over a
     medium heat until it boils gently. Adjust the heat to maintain a
     gentle boil and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally.
     The coconut cream will become fragrant as it thickens. When you
     see tiny pools of oil glistening on the surface add the curry paste
     and stir to dissolve it into the coconut cream. Continue cooking for
     1 to 2 minutes, until the curry paste has a pleasing aroma.
  
  3. Add the chicken pieces and stir fry for 1-2 minutes to coat them
     evenly with the paste. Cook for about 2 minutes. Increase the heat
     and add the coconut milk, eggplant, fish sauce, sugar and salt and
     stir well. Stir in the coriander, adjust the heat to maintain a gentle
     active boil and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste
     and adjust the seasoning with a little more fish sauce, sugar, or curry
     paste.
  
  4. When the chicken is done, and the eggplant is just tender, remove from
     the heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter basil leaves, chopped
     chillis and some coriander on the top. Serve.
  
  Preparation in advance:
  
  Prepare it up to the point where you add the coriander, except *DO NOT* add
  the eggplant. Cool to room temperature, cover, and refridgerate for up to
  24 hours. To serve bring the curry back to a gentle boil over a medium
  heat. Add the eggplant and carry on with the normal instructions from
  there.
  
  An alternative to the eggplant is Snow Peas. I personally prefer them, but
  both work well.

      1 tb Garlic, minced
      2    Thai finger peppers, crushed

      1 tb Orange or lemon peel, minced

-----------------------------SAUCE (MIX IN BOWL-----------------------------
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Soy Sauce
  1 1/2 t  Vinegar
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Chicken Stock

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 ea Egg White
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Soy Sauce
 
  This recipe is a combination of the best parts of many other General
  Tso's Chicken recipes I have seen. I use this recipe on a regular
  basis.
  I have used de-boned chicken thighs with good success. Have made it
  using orange or lemon peel and liked it with either. Have used small
  Vidalia onion in place of scallions also.
  Be careful when using the water chestnut flour, it doesn't brown as
  much as regular flour, so don't overcook. The sauce will make the
  dish darker. I tried using a deep fryer for cooking the chicken
  without success. The chicken kept sticking to the fryer basket. Have
  found that using a wok and cooking about 5 pieces of chicken at a
  time works better for me.
  Cut the chicken into pieces no larger than 1" square. Prepare
  marinade by combining egg white, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon soy
  sauce in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces and set aside for two
  hours. In a deep pot, heat the oil until it reaches 350 degrees.
  Dredge marinated chicken pieces in water chestnut powder to coat. In
  a basket, or with a slotted spoon, lower several marinated chicken
  pieces into the fat. Fry about one or two minutes or until the
  chicken becomes crisp; test for doneness before completing the batch.
  Continue until all pieces have been fried. Set oil and cooked chicken
  pieces aside. In a wok, on high heat, reheat two tablespoons of the
  reserved oil. Add prepared ginger, scallions, garlic, chili peppers,
  and orange or lemon peel. Stir to prevent burning. Add the fried
  chicken and stir quickly.Add sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and cornstarch
  mixed with chicken stock. Remove from the heat and stir sesame oil
  into the sauce. Spoon the mixture on to a hot platter and serve
  immediately with steamed rice. Serves 4.

    1/4 c  Japanese light soy sauce
    1/4 c  Sake or white wine
      4    Whole chicken breasts,halved
           Egg
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Cooking oil
 
  Put onion in large bowl. Cut the ends off the lemon, slice it and add
  to the onion. Add the sugar, sake, and soy sauce; stir well. Rinse
  and pat dry the chicken breasts, put them in the bowl and spoon the
  marinade over them. Marinate them for an hour at room temperature,
  stirring occasionally to be sure that all pieces are more or less
  equally marinated. In a dish or small mixing bowl, thoroughly beat
  the egg. Put the flour in a plastic bag, dip a couple of the chicken
  breasts in the egg and shake them with the flour in the bag to coat
  them. Heat the oil in the pan and add the floured chicken breasts.
  Repeat until all the pieces are coated and in the frypan. Brown the
  chicken on both sides over medium heat (it should take about 20 to 30
  minutes) and then add the marinade and simmer until the chicken is
  well cooked, perhaps another 30 minutes.

      Title: LEMON CHICKEN WITH BASIL
 Categories: Chicken, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Chicken breasts
      1 lb Mushrooms
      1    Lemon, sliced into thin wedg
      1 c  Tomato sauce-8 oz
      1    Basil; chopped fresh
      6    Sprouts
           Chives; chopped
    1/4 c  White wine-cheap
    1/2 c  Mozarella cheese, shredded *
      1 c  Rice, uncooked
           Parmesan cheese.
 
  Chicken breasts can be split to 4 pieces or cubed to bite size. In
  deep fry pan, saute chicken and mushrooms in half of the white wine
  with basil, lemon, and chives until mostly done. Splash in rest of
  wine (or extra) as needed.  Add tomato sauce, cover, and simmer for
  20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. When done,
  lemon wedges should be thoroughly cooked, and can be eaten.  Serve
  over steamed rice. Top with a sprinkle of parmesan or mozarella (not
  too much) and a little sprinkle of chives. (It's good without the
  cheese, too.) Garnish with a fresh sprig of basil and wedges from
  unused half of lemon. Serves 2 (plenty). NOTE: The white wine can be
  replaced with apple juice. As a matter of fact, I like mushrooms
  cooked in apple juice until it's reduced down to almost nothing. A
  lot less calories than cooking them in butter, and tastes great.
  Sometimes I'll put in a clove of garlic. (I haven't tried this when
  using apple juice instead of wine yet.) D PILEGGI (TDJR42A) Recipe:

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6    Boneless chicken breasts
           Salt & fresh ground pepper
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 lb Ham; finely chopped
           -- (about one cup)
      2    To 3 garlic clove
           -- peeled & finely chopped

           -- peeled & finely chopped
      4 tb Fresh tarragon; chopped
           -- (or preserved in vinegar)
      1 lg Lemon; chopped zest of
           Lemon juice or white wine
           Butter
           Vegetable mirepoix
      1 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Whipping cream
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  To prepare chicken breasts, place between sheets of waxed paper.
  Gently pound with a mallet until flat and tender.  Sprinkle each with
  salt, pepper and lemon juice.  Keep covered in refrigerator.
  
  To make stuffing, combine ham, garlic, ginger, half the tarragon and
  about 2/3 of the lemon zest in a bowl, blending well.  Add a dash of
  lemon juice or wine to moisten.
  
  To stuff breasts, place equal amounts of filling on center of each.
  Bring sides up to encase filling, shaping with your hands into a
  round package and tucking in ends to seal.  Greasy the shiny side of
  six, foot-long strips of foil, about 2 inches wide.  Encircle each
  breast with foil, greased side in, pulling tightly so that foil wraps
  around breast. (This retains shape during baking.)  Fold over edge on
  top to secure foil. Brush tops of chicken with butter.  Sprinkle with
  salt, pepper and a little tarragon.  Can be refrigerated, covered at
  this point, if baking is to be done several hours later.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Place the vegetable mirepoix in bottom of a
  large baking dish.  Place chicken breasts on top of vegetables. Pour
  enough wine around bottom of pan just to cover mirepoix. Bake 10 to
  12 minutes, then turn heat down to 350 degrees. Baste chicken. Cover
  pan loosely with foil and bake another 15 minutes or until chicken
  breasts are done but still moist inside. Remove foil covering from
  pan; turn broiler on to brown chicken tops, about 2 minutes.
  
  Remove pan from oven.  Place chicken on heated platter and keep warm;
  carefully remove foil strips.  Meanwhile, remove and discard mirepoix
  vegetables from roasting pan.  Place pan on top of stove.  Remove any
  surface fat and bring to a boil.  Add chicken stock and cream and
  reduce over high heat, stirring until of desired consistency.  Taste
  and adjust seasonings.
  
  To serve, garnish chicken breasts with remaining lemon zest and
  tarragon. Place a little sauce on a heated plate, then place chicken
  breast on top.
  
  Good served with rice-stuffed tomatoes.
  
  Serves 4 to 6, depending upon size of chicken breasts.
  
  Note:  Mirepoix means aromatic vegetables (carrot, celery and onion)
  chopped and placed in the bottom of a roasting pan).
  
  Most of this dish can be prepared in advance.

  in size by about one-third.  Set aside.
  Toast the almonds in a 325 F oven until light golden, then set aside.

  set aside. In a small bowl combine the sauce ingredients and mix well.
  LAST-MINUTE COOKING: Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of
  cold water.  Preheat the oven to warm.

  1 tablespoon cooking oil and then garlic and ginger.  Saute briefly,

  3. Mix sugar, vinegar, soya sauce, wine together in a small bowl.
  Reserve.
  
  4. Heat oil in wok until smoking, add dredged chicken, stir fry on all
  sides. If oil is hot enough for chicken, pieces will not stick to wok.
  
  5. Add sugar and vinegar reserve, hot peppers. Place cover over wok.
  Add 1/2 cup water, cook over medium heat 5 minutes. Self gravy should
  form in the bottom of wok. Stir chicken in gravy so it will cook in
  gravy. Gravy should become gelatinous after 5 minutes of cooking. If
  it becomes too thick, thin gravy out with small amounts of water.
  
  6. Sprinle in 1 cup of peanuts, mix thoroughly.
  
  NOTE: Canned hot peppers are too soft to be used for this dish. If
  desired, dried cayenne peppers can be reconstituted for use. If you
  are fond of this dish, it is well to freeze your own hot peppers, in
  season.

      Title: CHICKEN SOUP WITH GALANGAL (KAI TOM KHA)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Stalks lemon grass
      1 c  Water
      4 c  Coconut milk
      8    Chicken thighs or
  1 1/3 lb Chicken breast, diced
     10 sl Galangal
      2 tb Fish sauce
      3 sm Fresh chilies
      3    Bergamot leaves
      2 tb Lemon juice

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Spring onions, shredded
           Chilies, shredded
 
  This one's a bit more complex and gets into some exotic ingredients.
  All of them should be available from an Asian grocery.  If you have
  any questions about what the ingredients are or how to use them, just
  ask. The only thing that can not be substituted for is the fish
  sauce.  You could use ginger instead of galangal, but the soup would
  lack the perfumed, exotic aroma of the galangal that adds so much to
  the dish.
  
  Lime zest could be used for the bergamot leaves.
  
  Cut the lemon grass into 1-inch pieces.  Bring the water to the boil
  with half the coconut milk.  Then add the chicken, lemon grass,
  galangal and 1 tablespoon fish sauce.  Simmer for about 20 minutes or
  until the chicken is cooked.  Less cooking time will be required for
  diced chicken breast.
  
  Stir in the remaining coconut milk and turn up the heat.  As soon as
  it begins to boil, toss in the whole chilies and bergamot leaves.
  Stir, and remove from the heat.
  
  Serve in individual bowls.  Sprinkle each with lemon juice and fish
  sauce to taste and garnish with slivers of spring onions and chili.

      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
     12 oz Chicken breast, diced
      4 c  Water
      4 oz Straw mushrooms, chopped

      2    Spring onions, chipped
      1 pn Ground ginger

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Coriander leaves
 
  Here's another simple recipe.  Straw mushrooms are available canned
  in the Oriental section of many supermarkets or fresh in Asian
  groceries. Enoki mushrooms would probably be a good substitute,
  although I haven't tried that...
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan or wok and fry the garlic until soft but
  not brown.
  
  Add the chicken and stir-fry for 5 minutes. cool a little. Add the
  water and mushrooms.  Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 minutes.
  Add the lemon juice.  Cover, and cook gently for a further 10 minutes.
  
  Add the chilies, spring onions and ginger.  Remove from the heat.
  Sprinkle with coriander leaves before serving.

      2    Cloves garlic, minced,
           -divided
    1/4 ts Coarsely ground black
           -pepper, divided
      4    6-ounce boneless, skinless
           -chicken breast halves
      4 tb Plus 1 1/2 teaspoons olive
           -oil, divided
    1/4 c  Chopped shallots
      1 c  Marsala wine
      1 c  Homemade or canned chicken
           -broth
  2 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
    1/2 c  Sun-dried tomatoes,
           -julienned
    1/2 c  Sliced green onions
  1 1/2 c  Butter, cut into small
           -pieces (3 sticks)
 
  In a small flat dish, sprinkle half the oregano, thyme, rosemary,
  garlic and black pepper.  Place the chicken breast halves in a single
  layer on top of the herbs.  Pour 4 tablespoons olive oil over the
  chicken. Sprinkle the remaining herbs, garlic and pepper over the
  chicken breasts. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or
  overnight.
  
  While chicken is marinating, prepare the Marsala reduction.  In a
  saucepan, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.  Add shallots and saute
  until tender. Add the Marsala and chicken broth and stir to scrape up
  any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.  Bring to a simmer and
  cook until reduced by half. Skim off excess fat and strain to remove
  shallots.  Set aside.
  
  Grill or broil chicken breasts for about 7 to 8 minutes per side or
  until done.  While the chicken is cooking, preheat a saute pan.  Add
  the Marsala reduction, mushrooms, tomatoes and green onions.  Bring
  to a simmer and reduce by half.  Remove from heat and stir the butter
  into the sauce bit by bit, stirring constantly, until the sauce is
  slightly thickened.
  
  Serve the chicken breasts topped with the sauce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: GAI TOM KHA (THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP)
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Medium coconut milk
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      3 qt Pieces dried galangal
           -(kha), or
      6 qt Pieces fresh galangal
      4    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -bruised, cut into 2-inch
           -lengths
      6    Fresh Serrano chiles,
           -sliced into rounds
      1 lg Whole chicken breast *
      4 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      5    Fresh Kaffir lime leaves
           -(makrut), if available
      2    Fresh limes, juice
      2 tb Chopped coriander leaves
 
  *  cut into 1/2-inch pieces (with or without bones, see note)
  
  Combine coconut milk, chicken stock, galangal, lemon grass and 4 of
  the chiles in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for 20 minutes.  Strain stock; discard galangal and lemon grass.
  Return stock to a boil, add chicken and simmer until tender, about 2
  minutes.  Add fish sauce, citrus leaves and remaining chiles.  Stir
  in the lime juice. Garnish with coriander.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.
  
  NOTE:  I like to use boned chicken breast if I'm cooking for guests.
  For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
  small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
  is tender.

      Title: JELLYFISH, DAIKON AND CHICKEN BREASTY SALAD
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried, salted whole
           -jellyfish
      1    1-pound daikon radish
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 lg Chicken breast
    1/2    Egg white
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Dry sherry
      3 tb Peanut oil
      2 tb Sesame oil
      3    Scallions, chopped
 
  Here's a classic Chinese "texture" dish, a cold salad made of with
  dried jellyfish.  I know jellyfish sounds bizarre, but, after
  soaking, the jellyfish has a texture similar to woodears-crunchy and
  crisp with little taste of its own.  I consider the addition of the
  chicken to be a sop to those who like to see recognizable things in
  their food...
  
  Actually, this would probably be quite good with just the chicken or
  just the jellyfish.  It has a light dressing made of mixed oils and
  wine. Very nice on a hot summers day.  More than likely, you'll have
  to go to a Chinese market to get the jellyfish.  This is another
  recipe from my huge pile of clippings.  It's from the SF Chronicle,
  but I don't know the date.
  
  Soak the jellyfish in a large bowl of cold water for 24 hours,
  changing the water a couple of times.  Peel the daikon with a
  vegetable peeler; slice thinly; stack slices and cut into matchstick
  shreds.  Put into a mixing bowl, toss with the 2 teaspoons of salt
  and let stand 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, drain water from jellyfish.  Pour boiling water over the
  jellyfish and let stand for 15 seconds.  Drain and run under cold
  water. Set aside.
  
  Bone the chicken breast and slice thinly; cut slices into shreds. Mix
  chicken with the egg white, cornstarch and teaspoon of sesame oil;
  refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  While the chicken is marinating, cut jellyfish into the thinnest
  possible shreds by rolling up each sheet and slicing it thinly.
  Place in a large bowl.  Wring most of the moisture from the daikon
  shreds; add to the bowl with the jellyfish.  Heat 3 cups water in a
  saucepan.  When boiling, turn off the heat and add the chicken
  shreds, stirring to separate the pieces. Simmer for 1 minute.  Drain
  and rinse under cold water. Drain and add to the bowl with the
  jellyfish.
  
  Blend the salt and sugar with the wine until they dissolve.  Heat the
  oils in a saucepan and add the seasoned wine.  It will sputter and
  evaporate. When the oil is hot++don't let it smoke++turn off the heat
  and add the scallions.  Cool.  Toss with the salad just before
  serving.

    1/3 c  Liquefied gravy sauce
           -powder, or beef stock (see
           -below)
   3/16 c  Port wine

-------------------------CHIVE CREAM SAUCE (1/3 CUP-------------------------
     10 g  Chopped shallots
   3/16 c  Wine
           Few drops of white wine
    150 g  Chicken stock
    120 g  Cream
      5 g  Chopped chives
           Olive oil

      1    Egg
    1/2    Egg yolk
   3/16 c  Cream

     50 g  Diced tomato
     10 g  Chopped truffle
     10 g  Chopped chives
 
  This looks pretty tasty++lamb fillets stuffed with minced chicken and
  served with potato pancakes.  The presentation looks like something
  seen through a kaleidoscope++overlapping triangles formed by the
  three lamb fillets, the potato pancakes, the morels and the sauces.
  Here again, I believe that "shallots" are in reality scallions.  The
  "pork net" is more than likely a web of caul fat.

  To prepare: 1. Soak morels over night in cold water and wash
  thoroughly Discard stalks. 2.  Cut off and discard lamb fillet's
  stringy part. Season fillet with salt and pepper.  Using barbecue
  skewers, pierce through fillet lengthways, stretching meat apart
  slightly to form a central hole about 1.5 cms wide. Stuff chicken
  force meat into hole (one way is to use a piping or icing bag). 3.
  To make port wine sauce:  either make a beef stock which includes
  sauteed mixed vegetables, herbs (rosemary, thyme and black pepper)
  and tomato paste, or liquefy the contents of a gravy sauce packet to
  produce a thick 1/3 cup of gravy.  Add port wine, maintaining a thick
  consistency. Keep warm. 4.  To make chive cream sauce: saute chopped
  shallots in a little oil, add Madeira wine, few drops of white wine,
  and chicken stock.  Boil until thick, then add cream. Strain and add
  chopped chives, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper according to
  taste. Keep warm. 5.  Make 12 small golden-brown potato pancakes.
  Keep warm.
  
  To cook: 1. Saute morels in butter, with seasoning (salt, pepper and
  chicken stock, according to taste) for 2 to 3 minutes. 2.  Lightly
  blanch broccoli florets, then discard stalks.  Saute florets in
  butter with seasoning (salt, pepper and chicken stock, according to
  taste) for 1 to 2 minutes. 3.  Cut stalks off lettuce and blanch
  leaves.  Wrap one layer of lettuce leaves around stuffed lamb.  Then
  wrap it completely with sheet of pork net, folding net over the ends
  to enclose them. 4.  Pan-fry stuffed lamb in melted butter (a
  soupspoonful) over a low flame for approximately 5 minutes until
  lightly browned. 5.  Remove lamb to a roasting dish and roast in its
  own juices in an oven (250F) for 20 to 25 minutes, turning it every 4
  or 5 minutes. 6.  When lamb is cooled, remove from oven, and
  carefully take off pork net wrapping.  Slice the lettuce-wrapped
  fillet into 12 portions.
  
  To present: 1. Dress centre of each plate with a large spoonful of
  chive cream sauce. 2.  Spoon out three separate portions of port wine
  sauce so that they touch the chive cream sauce. 3.  Lay lamb slices
  sideways on port wine sauce. 4.  Place three potato pancakes in
  spaces between lamb slices and lay a broccoli floret on each pancake.
  5.  Garnish chive cream sauce with morels and a central heap of diced
  tomato.  Scatter a few specks of truffle over each lamb slice, and a
  sprinkling of chopped chives over central garnish display.

      Title: MEE KROB (THAI CRISP FRIED NOODLES)
 Categories: Thai, Pasta, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 bn Rice vermicelli, about 8
           -ounces
           Oil for deep frying
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      5    Garlic cloves, finely
           -chopped
    1/2 lb Pork fillet, sliced and cut
           -into 1" long pieces
      1    Whole chicken breast,
           -boned, sliced and cut into
           -1" pieces.
      6    Dried Chinese mushrooms
           -(shiitake), soaked and
           -finely sliced.
      2 sm Fresh chilies, seeded and
           -finely sliced.
      3 tb Soy sauce.
           Juice from 2 limes.
      2 tb Rice vinegar.
      4    Or 5 tablespoons sugar,
           -granulated, brown or palm.
      3 tb Fish sauce.
      3 tb Small shrimp++cooked or raw.
      4    Eggs, beaten.
           Handful of bean sprouts
      6    Green onions, finely
           -chopped.
      4 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
      2    Green onions, cut for
           -decoration.
 
  Optional stuff: crab meat, bean curd, dried shrimp
  
  Tear noodles into handful bunches (inside a large shopping bag to
  avoid a mess).  Heat oil and fry the noodles until they puff up.
  Flip over for a few seconds.  Do this by bunches and drain in bag.
  Pour off oil, leaving 6 tablespoons in wok.  Fry the onions and
  garlic lightly.
  
  Add pork and cook it through.  Add chicken and fry until it turns
  white. Put in mushrooms and chilies and reduce heat.  In a bowl,
  combine soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, sugar and fish sauce.  Add to
  wok and simmer until liquid is reduced by half and starting to turn
  syrupy.  Add shrimp and cook for 1 minute.  Push contents of wok to
  the sides and pour beaten eggs into center of wok.  Let set for a
  minute then stir and add the bean sprouts and drained noodles.  Toss
  LIGHTLY (the noodles are fragile) to mix ingredients and then let
  heat through.  Transfer to serving platter and garnish with cilantro
  and green onions.
  
  NOTE:  Rice vermicelli are also known as rice sticks or cellophane
  noodles depending on where you find them.  All the Asian cuisines
  that I've encountered have some variation of them.  Use the thinnest
  you can find. Other kinds of noodles won't work.  When they hit the
  hot oil, they kinda go "whooosh" and double or triple in size and
  turn a milky white. Kids really like to watch the process.  The oil
  MUST be fresh and hot (375F to 400F) or the centers may be tough.
  
  This recipe makes enough for 6-8 people.  I'd recommend halving it
  for less than that.  It's a sweet/sour dish with the emphasis on the
  sweet. Very tasty and rich.

------------------------------CHICKEN FILLING------------------------------
      1 lg Plump chicken breast
    1/2 c  Celery (tops and tender,
           -inside stalks)
    1/2 md White onion
      2    Or 3 peppercorns
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Red pepper
      1    Yellow pepper
  1 1/2 lg Red onions
    1/2 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste

--------------------------------BEAN FILLING--------------------------------
      1 lb Bag of pinto beans (red or
           -pink)
      8 c  Water
           Salt to taste
    1/4    Onion
    1/4 c  Olive oil
 
  Poach chicken with celery tops, onions and peppercorns.  Cook for
  about 15 minutes.  Let cool and remove skin.  When chicken is
  skinned, slice or shred, then saute with olive oil in wok or large
  skillet until barely browned around the edges.  Next add red and
  yellow peppers and red onions. Toss and saute for about 10 minutes.
  Watch closely so that peppers don't go limp.  Add cilantro leaves.
  Remove from heat.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Combine with beans
  (see below).  Place in tortillas, top with salsa and serve.
  
  Cook beans in water for approximately 1 1/2 hours on medium heat.
  
  Make sure that beans are completely covered in water.  Stir
  occasionally. Beans will absorb liquid and become soft.  Add more
  water if needed.  Add salt when beans are thoroughly cooked.  Remove
  from heat.  Add chopped onion.  (Onions will cook from the heat of
  the beans.) Drizzle with olive oil.  Let sit.
  
  TORTILLAS: Warm six large flour tortillas in microwave on high (in
  large zip lock bag to preserve moisture) for about 30 seconds.
  
  SALSA: Two large, peeled and chopped tomatoes.

------------------------------CHICKEN MARINADE------------------------------
    1/2 ts Grated ginger
      2 ts Soy sauce
      2 ts Dry vermouth or Shao Hsing
           -wine
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper

  * cut diagonally into 1-inch slices ** soaked in warm water until
  soft and pliable (about 30 minutes) *** soaked in warm water for 30
  minutes
  
  Foods wrapped in dried lotus leaves become infused with an exotic
  earthy flavor.  If lotus leaves are not available, you can wrap the
  rice filling in oiled parchment.  Besides being an unusual appetizer,
  this dish can be served as a snack, for lunch, or as a light meal.
  Note that the first step must be done the night before.  Because
  lotus leaves vary so much in size, eight packets may require anywhere
  from four to ten leaves. (Larger leaves can be split in half, smaller
  leaves may need to be overlapped.)
  
  1.  The night before, pour boiling water over the lotus leaves and
  let them soak for 1 hour.  Rinse and squeeze them dry.  Mix the long-
  grain and glutinous rice together in a large bowl.  Wash the rice
  under running cold water; gently stir and rub the grains between your
  fingers to loosen all the excess starch.  Continue until the water
  runs clear. Drain thoroughly. Mix the rice with the chicken stock in
  a 2-quart saucepan; soak overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  2.  The next day, set the saucepan of rice uncovered over high heat;
  bring to a boil.  Stir just enough to loosen the rice grains.  Reduce
  the heat to medium-high and boil until the liquid is absorbed, about
  8 to 10 minutes. Put the sausages on top of the rice and cover the
  pan.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes.  Turn off the
  heat but do not remove the cover.  Let the rice stand for 10 minutes,
  then, with a wet wooden spoon, transfer it to a large bowl; set aside.
  
  3.  Squeeze the mushrooms dry.  Cut off the stems at the base and
  discard them; cut the caps in half.  Combine the marinade ingredients
  in a medium bowl.  Cut the chicken breast into 3/4-inch chunks and
  toss it with the marinade.  Add the mushrooms and marinate for 20
  minutes.  Drain and coarsely chop the shrimp.
  
  4.  In a small bowl combine the soy sauce, sugar, white pepper, and
  sesame oil; mix into the cooked rice.  Add the chicken-mushroom
  mixture and the shrimp.
  
  5.  Fold a lotus leaf in half and put it on a cutting board.  If the
  middle stem or edges are tough and hard, trim and discard them.  (If
  the leaves are small, you may need to over- lap halves.) Divide the
  rice mixture into 8 portions; place one portion in the center of a
  leaf half. Fold the edges over the rice to make a 4-inch square
  packet.  Tie it with twine. Repeat with the remaining leaves and
  rice.  Arrange the packets in a single layer in a bamboo steaming
  basket.
  
  6.  Prepare a wok for steaming.  Steam the packets over medium-high
  heat for 20 minutes.  Remove them from the steamer and cut each
  packet across the top to expose its contents.  Serve with small
  dishes of soy sauce for dipping.
  
  NOTE:  Sweet glutinous rice is also known as "sticky rice" because
  when it is cooked it becomes sticky.  It is used to make poultry
  stuffing and leaf-wrapped rice packages; it is called sweet rice
  because it is often used to make sweet dishes.  Soak it overnight
  before cooking for the best results.
  
  Makes 8 packets.

      2 oz Dried mung bean noodles
      1 tb To 2 tb vegetable oil
      1    Whole chicken breast,
           -boned, skinned and
           -coarsely chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Fresh red or green chile,
           -chopped
      3 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
      1 ts Sugar
      3    Shallots, peeled, thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves
      6 oz Cooked bay shrimp
           Shredded lettuce
      1 tb To 2 tb crisp-fried shallots
           -(optional)
 
  This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the
  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With
  this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than
  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when
  buying.
  
  Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.
  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes).  Drain.  Add
  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook
  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes).  Drain in a
  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again.  Cut into 3 or 4 inch
  lengths.
  
  Chill.
  
  Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it
  loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels.  Season with salt
  and pepper to taste.  Cool.
  
  Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and
  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly.  Add chicken, shrimp
  and chilled noodles; mix well.
  
  Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp
  fried shallots.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.
  
  As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make.  Just
  fry some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and
  crisp.  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in
  the same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor
  accent. Good stuff!

  This looks like a nice dish++chicken breast stuffed with wild rice,
  some veggies and crepe strips to fill in for noodles.
  
  Establishment: Hotel Riverside Plaza Tai Chang Kiu Road, Shatin, New
  Territories. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hot entree
  Chef: Chan Chi-hung Philip (Hotel Riverside Plaza)
  
  To prepare: 1. Precook wild rice as a pilaf with chopped onions,
  chicken stock, and appropriate amount of water. When cool, add grated
  Parmesan cheese and let mixture cool.
  
  2.  Cut chicken breast portions butterfly style (i.e. slice in half
  and spread open.  Flatten and slightly stretch them (by gently
  pounding them between two sheets of wax paper or inside a clean
  plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  3.  Lay a cone-shaped portion of rice stuffing on one side of each
  flattened breast.  Roll chicken breast up in a cone shape.  Wrap each
  cone firmly in aluminum foil (to maintain shape during cooking:  the
  professional recipe calls for plastic foil wrapping, but aluminum
  foil is recommended for home cooking).
  
  4.  Blanch green leek stems, then refresh in cold water.
  
  5.  Make 4 very thin crepes about 20 cms wide (ingredients not
  included above).
  
  To cook: 1. Blanch pearled vegetables, celery and peas, then saute in
  approximately 10 g butter, adding salt and pepper according to taste.
  Keep a quarter aside.
  
  2.  To make sauce, reduce chicken stock and add fresh cream.  Cook
  briefly, then strain.  Add fresh lemon juice and finish with butter
  as required. Adjust seasoning and add chopped chervil according to
  taste.
  
  3.  Saute morels in approximately 10 g butter.
  
  4.  Heat some chicken stock (5 cups should be sufficient to completely
  cover the four wrapped chicken portions).  Simmer breasts in hot
  stock for approximately 7 minutes.  Remove from pan, discard aluminum
  foil wrappings, and saute in approximately 60 g butter until lightly
  browned. Then slice each into six portions, cut at an angle (30 to 40
  degrees).
  
  To present: Treasure Hunt takes the form of a chicken breast "boat",
  with morel oars being rowed towards crepe "treasure bag" of vegetable
  "precious stones" some of which have spilled on the shore.
  
  1.  Portion out 3/4 of vegetable pearls, celery and peas onto crepes
  lifting crepe edges upwards to form bag shapes.  Tie tops of bags with
  blanched green leek stems (with decorative knotted bows if stems are
  long enough).
  
  2.  Pour sauce onto plates.  Arrange chicken slices in a line on
  sauce, lay thick ends of morels between them.  Place a crepe bag on
  each plate, with reserved vegetable pearls laid beside bag.  Garnish
  with chervil sprigs (or watercress or parsley).

      Title: YAM SOM-O (THAI POMELO-CHICKEN SALAD)
 Categories: Thai, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Pomelo or ruby red
           -grapefruit
      1 sm Whole cooked chicken breast
      1 c  Cooked shrimp
      1 ts Chopped red chile
  1 1/2 tb Thai fish sauce
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
           Juice from 1 large lime
  1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh coriander
      1 sm Head red leaf lettuce, for
           -garnish
    1/4 c  Roasted peanuts, chopped
           Fresh red chile, julienned
           -for garnish

------------------------CRISPY FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES------------------------
      6    Shallots, thinly sliced
      1 c  Vegetable oil
 
  It's almost Chinese New Year and the stores are all stocking up on
  fresh fruits which are a traditional Chinese gift for the season.
  Pomelos are a big citrus fruit much like grapefruit, but somewhat
  drier and sweeter. This Thai recipe makes use of them and you should
  be able to find them this time of year.  If not grapefruit will do.
  This is from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 1/30/91, by
  Joyce Jue.
  
  Peel and separate pomelo or grapefruit into segments.  Remove the
  membranes.  Seed.  Gently flake the flesh apart into a bowl.  Chill.
  Hand shred the chicken.  Add chicken and shrimp to pomelo.
  
  In a small bowl mix together the chopped red chile with fish sauce,
  sugar, lime juice and coriander; toss with pomelo chicken mixture.
  
  Arrange the lettuce on a serving platter.  Put the fruit mixture over
  the lettuce.  Top with peanuts and 2 tablespoons of Crisp Fried
  Shallot Flakes, and garnish with red chile slivers.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as a salad entree.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure
  they are all of the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan
  with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly
  until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the
  shallots should be completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel. Store
  in an air-tight container.  Will keep several weeks.

      4 sm Carrots, cut into 1/2"
           -diagonal slices (~1 1/2 c)
      2 c  Broccoli florets
  1 1/2 c  Quartered button mushrooms
           Rich pastry crust
      2    Egg yolks, beaten
 
  This refined version of an old American classic has a rich, flaky,
  meaty-tasting crust, thanks to its mixture of lard and chicken fat.
  The latter is a handy byproduct of the precooking of the chicken the
  day before. Make sure the chicken fat is good and cold when making
  the crust.
  
  Season chicken parts to taste with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons
  butter and oil together in soup pot. Add chicken and brown. Add
  chicken broth, quartered onion, celery chunks and carrot chunks and
  bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender, 20-30
  minutes. Let cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Next day, skim cold chicken fat off top of broth. Reserve 1/4 cup fat
  for making Rich Pastry Crust. (Keep reserved chicken fat in
  refrigerator.)
  
  Heat broth and remove chicken. Skin and bone chicken parts. Discard
  skin and bones. Cut meat into 2" chunks and set aside.
  
  Strain broth. Reduce over high heat to 3 cups. Combine 1/4 cup melted
  butter and flour in saucepan and gradually stir in broth. Bring to
  boil and boil 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in
  tarragon.
  
  Cook pearl onions, potato, sliced carrots and broccoli separately in
  boiling water until tender, 5-10 minutes each. Drain.
  
  Toss together cooked chicken, cooked vegetables and mushrooms. Stir in
  chicken-tarragon sauce. Divide into 4 (2 cup) oval casseroles.
  
  Make Rich Pastry Crust. Divide dough in half and gather into 2 small
  flattened rounds. Roll first half on lightly floured board to 1/4"
  thick Cut dough to fit tops of 2 casseroles, leaving enough dough to
  overhang edges by 1". Repeat with second half of dough.
  
  Brush edges of casseroles with egg yolk and place crusts atop
  casseroles. Flute edges. Make 4 triangular cuts in center of each
  crust and fold back tips of triangles. Brush crust with egg yolk
  (save egg whites for another use). Bake at 400'F. until crust is
  golden brown and contents hot and bubbly, 20-30 minutes. Makes 4
  servings.

      1 t  Hot pepper sauce, to taste
      4 c  Chicken broth or stock
      1 T  Fresh lemon juice
      2 lg Bay leaves
      2 lg Garlic cloves, minced
      1 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/4 lb Precooked, coarsely chopped
           -andouille sausage or other
           -spicy garlic sausage
 
  NOTE: This tasty stew will reward you for the time it takes to make a
  proper roux, which add depth.
  
  Heat the oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven. Working in small batches
  over medium-high heat, brown the chicken pieces on all sides (skin
  side down first). With thongs, remove each browned batch to a platter.
  
  After all the chicken is browned, make a New Orleans-style roux; Pour
  the remaining oil form the Dutch oven into a measuring cup. Return
  1/4 cup to the Dutch oven and heat over medium heat. Add the flour
  and stir, scraping flour from the bottom of the pan as it slowly
  browns. Stir constantly until the roux is a rich brown, the color of
  a paper bag. (Be careful: When a roux begins to brown, it can burn
  very quickly and will continue to cook, even off the heat, until
  liquid is added.) This will take about 20 minutes.
  
  Immediately stir in the onions, celery and peppers. Cook until wilted,
  about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, lemon juice, hot
  pepper sauce, bay leaves, broth, garlic, salt and pepper. Bring to a
  simmer
  
  Remove the skin and visible fat from the chicken. Return to the pan.
  Simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Add the sausage. Skim off
  fat as it collects on top of the sauce. Cook another 30 minutes, or
  until the chicken is tender and the sauce is thick.
  
  TO SERVE AFTER FREEZING: Thaw as recommended. Reheat slowly in a
  covered pot over medium-low heat. Serve in shallow soup dishes over
  freshly cooked white rice. Serves 12.

      Title: SUNDAY CHICKEN REVISITED
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Whole chicken breasts, skin
           -left on (weight after
           -boning, 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 lb)
      3 tb Butter, cut into 6 pieces
           -and slightly softened
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
    3/4 t  Cornstarch, mixed with
      1 tb Water
 
  NOTE: Because most boneless chicken breasts these days come without
  skin, ask your butcher to so it specially, or buy bone-in breasts and
  bone them yourself.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425'F. Rub the chicken breasts on all sides with
  butter; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fold each breast in half, skin
  side out, stretching the skin as much as possible to cover the meat.
  Hold the "bundle" together by running through with wooden or metal
  skewers.
  
  Bake on the rack of a roasting pan for 25-30 minutes, or until an oven
  thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers
  155-160'F. Remove to a cutting board. Loosely cover with aluminum
  foil to keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, add the broth to the roasting pan. Scrape the pan with a
  wooden spatula to dissolve the meat juices. Pour this liquid into a
  fat separator (or a regular measuring cup) and wait a bit for the fat
  to rise to the top. Pour off (or spoon off) the fat. Pour the
  defatted liquid into a small pan and bring to a rapid boil. Boil down
  to 3/4 cup of liquid. Stir in the dissolved cornstarch, and cook
  until the gravy thickens slightly.
  
  Discard the chicken skin, if you like. Cut each breast diagonally into
  about eight long, thin slices. Arrange on a platter and pass the gravy
  separately.
  
  Per 5 1/2 ounce serving, with 2 tablespoons gravy: 271 calories, 48
  grams protein, 0.7 grams carbohydrates, 0 grams fiber, 7 grams fat
  (2.5 grams saturated), 661 milligrams sodium.

           Seasoned salt (opt)
      2    Chicken breasts, cut in half
 
  Mix ingredients together and warm them in small pan or in microwave
  just to melt and thin the honey in the mixture. Arrange 4 chicken
  breast halves skin-side up in a 9" square baking dish sprayed with
  vegetable oil. Bake uncovered at 400'F. about 35-40 minutes, basting
  pieces in the marinade without turning them, every 8-10 minutes or
  until nicely browned.
  
  Immediately upon removing from the oven, seal the dish in foil and let
  stand 10-15 minutes. Serves 4 without leftovers.

      Title: CURRY IN A HURRY
 Categories: Indian, Curry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp or boneless, skinless
           -chicken breasts
  2 1/2 tb Oil
  1 1/2 t  Curry powder
    1/4 t  Red chili powder or
           -cayenne pepper
      1 t  Crushed garlic
      1 cn Crushed or whole skinless
           -tomatoes, chopped (1 lb)
      1 t  Crushed ginger (opt)
           Salt to taste
      1 tb Heavy cream (opt)
    1/4 c  Fresh chopped coriander
    1/2 t  Lemon juice
 
  If using shrimp, clean and devein. Saute them lightly on both sides
  until they become pinkish, then set aside. If using chicken, cut the
  meat into 1" strips and set aside. In a saucepan or wok, heat the oil
  and "splutter fry" the curry powder and red chili powder and then the
  garlic rapidly for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, then add the ginger,
  if desired, and salt; mix well and bring to a boil. Add the chicken
  or shrimp, and simmer until cooked (3-5 minutes for the shrimp, 6-10
  minutes for the chicken). Finally, do the "fimmering" process,
  simmering on high heat until the oil floats to the top for a minute
  or so. Remember that overcooking or overspicing can kill the curry.
  Use the optional cream to tame the curry or adjust the flavor.
  Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and a squeeze of lemon juice.
  Serves 2 as a main dish, 3-4 when served with other dishes.

      2 tb Rice wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
      2 ts Honey
      3 tb Grated fresh ginger
           ..........................
      8 oz Chicken breast, boneless
           -skinless
      8 oz Dried spinach fettucine
    1/2 c  Chicken stock, fat skim off
      1 md Yellow squash, trimmed
           -and cut into matchsticks
      1 md Red bell pepper, trimmed &
           -cut into strips
      1 lg Leek, white part only, trim

      2 c  Broccoli florets -1 bundle
      1 c  Chopped mushrooms

  and mix thoroughly at low speed.
  Place the chicken in a shallow baking dish.  Pour half of the mixture from
  the blender over the poultry, reserving the remainder. Cover and
  refrigerate the chicken for 20 minutes.
  While the chicken is marinating, bring a large pot of water to boil over
  high heat.  Add the fettucini and cook for 8 to 12 minutes, to desired
  doneness.
  In the meantime, remove the chicken from the refrigerator. Uncover the
  baking dish and transfer it to the oven. Bake for 15 minutes, until the
  meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear.
  When the pasta is cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Drain the fettucini
  and return it to the pot. Stir in the chicken stock and keep the mixture
  warm over the lowest heat setting.
  Pour the cooking juices from the chicken into a saute' pan. Add the squash,
  bell pepper, leek, broccoli and mushrooms. Saute for about 3 minutes, just
  until the vegetables begin to wilt.
  Transfer the pasta to a warm serving bowl, along with the vegetables. Shred
  the chicken on top.  Add the reserved dressing and toss. Garnish with the
  snipped chives.

  Hugo Arnold's Commentary Follows.
  
  THAI food seems to have erupted into British life over the past few
  years, particularly in pubs, where many have ditched sausages and chips
  for Nam Tok, Tom Yam Gung or Grat Doo Moo Nueng Dow Jeow - the latter
  being Thai spare ribs. Alongside this explosion runs the increasing
  availability of the ingredients necessary to produce these dishes -
  lemon grass, kaffir lime, galangal and a few cookery books to explain
  the process.
  
  Vatcharin Bhumichitr wants us not only to cook Thai food, but to
  understand it. His latest book, Vatch's Thai Cookbook (Pavilion 17.99),
  groups recipes and writings under different ingredient headings. This
  approach, he hopes, will enable readers to appreciate the subtleties and
  origins of this intrinsically delicate cuisine. Mr Bhumichitr owns
  Chiang Mai, a Thai restaurant in Soho that serves up the sort of food I
  remember eating in Bangkok - light, delicate, spicy and well balanced an
  aspect frequently misunderstood, but well explained in this title. His
  book is full of similar recipes. Most are remarkably quick to cook, and
  ideal for that Thursday evening when you don't really have time to cook
  a stew or casserole. Today's recipe is from the bamboo shoots section of
  the book.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN AND COCONUT MILK SOUP (TOM KA GAI OR KAI TOM
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let stand while you prepare the
  rest of the soup.  In a medium saucepan, place the coconut milk, lemon
  grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and (optionally) chiles.
  (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole dish to taste
  spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the hotter the
  resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
  stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
  below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
  pieces are finished cooking.  Remove from heat and serve immediately
  with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
  of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
  birds.  We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
  southeast Asian or Caribbean?  Who cares, it was wonderful.  If you
  can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
  ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
  monkfish.  I believe I've had this with shrimp as well.  (Grouper,
  BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in
  other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very
  tender, and quite delicately flavored.  I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd
  guess that Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes:
  ======
  1.  Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available in most
  Asian groceries.  If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin
  Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in
  from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
  could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
  mild.  I like it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
  can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient
  demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just
  eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

      Title: CHICKEN & RED BELL PEPPER BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Pasta, Low-fat, Sauces, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped fine
      1 md Garlic clove, chopped fine
    1/2 lb Ground chicken breast
    1/2 c  Chardonnay or other dry
           - white wine
      1 cn Salt-free whole tomatoes
           - (16-ounce)
      1 tb Double-concentrate tomato
           - paste
      1 tb Fresh basil leaves, finely
           - shredded
      1 tb Fresh Italian parsley,
           - finely chopped
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh rosemary leaves,
           - finely chopped
      2 md Red bell peppers, roasted,
           -peeled, stemmed, seeded,
           -and coarsely chopped,
           -juices saved
           Cooked pasta of your choice
 
  In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil with the onion and
  garlic over moderate heat. When they sizzle, add the chicken and saute it,
  stirring and breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until it begins to
  brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
  
  Add the wine and stir and scrape well to deglaze the pan. Add the
  tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands, and stir in the remaining
  ingredients.
  
  Simmer the sauce until thick but still slightly liquid, 20 to 25 minutes.
  Spoon over cooked pasta -- spaghetti, fettuccine or medium-sized tubles,
  shells or other shapes are recommended.
  
  Directions for roasting bell peppers:
  ~------------------------------------
  Place the peppers in a foil-lined baking sheet in a 500 degree oven.
  Roast until their skins are evenly blistered and browned, about 25
  minutes, turning them 2 or 3 times so they roast evenly. Remove them from
  the oven and cover them with a kitchen towel.
  
  When the peppers are cool enough to handle, pull out their stems, peel
  away their blackened skins; open the peppers up; and remove their seeds,
  using a teaspoon to pick up any stray ones.
  
  Take care not to lose any of the peppers' juices, which are also very
  flavorful. You might want to pour them through a fine mesh strainer to
  remove any seeds or bits of skin.

     15 oz Boneless chicken breasts
      1 tb + 1 tsp olive oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      2 cl Garlic, minced
      1 tb Flour
  1 1/2 c  Sliced mushrooms
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Chopped parsley
  1 1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Chicken seasoning(I added)
      1 oz (2 T) dry sherry
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Nonfat sour cream
 
  1. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces. In a large nonstick skillet,
  over medium high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until hot but not
  smoking. Add the chicken and cook, stirring until browned, about 3-5
  minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and cover loosely to keep warm.
  
  2. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the skillet. Add the onion
  and garlic, and cook, stirring until the onion begins to brown (3-5
  minutes). Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, until the flour is no
  longer visible, about 30 seconds.
  
  3. Add the mushrooms, chicken broth, parsley, sherry, thyme, and
  pepper, and bring to a boil, stirring, until the mixture has
  thickened slightly. Return the chicken to the skillet and cook until
  heated through, about 1 minute.
  
  4. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the sour cream.
  
  NOTE: You can make this ahead of time, reserving the addition of the
  sour cream just before you serve it. I served this over cooked egg
  noodles, with French bread and chunky applesauce, and it was GREAT!

      Title: STEAMED ANISE CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Limes
      1 tb Brown sugar
      4    Star anise, divided (see
           Note)
    1/8 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Low-sodium soy sauce
    1/3 c  Water
      4    Boneless and skinless
           Chicken breast halves
 
  1. Squeeze the juice out of the limes.  Reserve the peels.  Measure 3
     tablespoons juice.
  
  2. In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, brown sugar, 2 star anise,
     crushed red pepper, soy sauce and water.  Bring to a boil, reduce the
     heat and simmer 4 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool.
  
  3. Put the chicken in a glass dish and spoon half of the soy mixture over,
     turning to coat.  Marinate at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and
     refrigerate for longer marination, up to 24 hours.
  
  4. When ready to steam the chicken, put the lime peels, 2 star anise and
     about 8 cups of water into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Fit a
     steamer basket or rack over the top.  Remove the chicken from the
     marinade, discarding the leftover marinade, and place in the steamer.
     Cover tightly and steam about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is no
     longer pink in the center.
  
  5. In a small saucepan cook down the remaining soy mixture until reduced
     to about 2 tablespoons.  (You can add a little water if you reduce the
     mixture too much.)  Spoon over the steamed chicken.
  
  Note: Star anise is a dried spice with a pungent, licorice flavour.  It
  can be purchased at most Asian groceries.  You can substitute 1/2 teaspoon
  lightly crushed anise seed for 2 star anise, although the flavour will not
  be as distinctive.

      1 t  Garlic salt, divided
      2 t  Sherry, divided
      2 t  Cornstarch, divided
      1 lb Shrimp, cleaned and peeled
      3 T  Oil, divided
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2    Celery stalks, finely
           -chopped
      1 T  Soy sauce
    1/2 lb Mushrooms, sliced
           Ginger (1"), peeled
           -and minced
      3    Garlic toes, peeled
           -and minced
      4 c  Rice, cooked, cold
      6 oz Ham, diced
      8 oz Snow peas, fresh or frozen
      2    Eggs, beaten
 
  Note:  Chow Fan is best made the day before you plan to serve it.
  
  Cut boned chicken into 1/2 squares; place in a bowl and sprinkle with half
  the garlic salt, half the sherry and half the cornstarch. Cut the peeled
  shrimp into pieces 1" long.  Put them in a bowl with the rest of the garlic
  salt, sherry and cornstarch.
  
  Heat 2 T oil over high heat in a wok or large pan.  Add onions and celery
  and stir-fry for 2 minutes.  Add soy sauce; reduce heat to medium, cover
  and steam one minute.  Add mushrooms, cover and steam 2 more minutes.
  Remove mixture to a large bowl.
  
  Add remaining oil to wok, reduce heat to low and add ginger and garlic.
  Brown lightly, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Add chicken and
  shrimp.  Stir-fry two minutes, or until shrimp are pink and opaque.
  
  Add cooked rice, onion mixture and ham.  Stir until hot.  Remove from heat,
  put into a storage container and chill overnight. When ready to serve,
  reheat in a wok or large pot.  Stir in snow peas and cook two minutes. Make
  a well in the center of the wok and stir in the beaten eggs. Stir them as
  they cook, about 3 minutes, so they scramble and mix with the other
  ingredients. Cover and cook over medium heat another couple of minutes.
  Serve at once.
  
  Serves 12 as part of a family style Chinese dinner, or 4 as a main dish.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  When Cathe originally gave me this recipe in the mid 70's it called for
  just 3/4 cup shrimp (1/2 pound), 1/2 cup each diced onion and celery, 1/2
  cup boiled ham (1/4 lb), 1/2 cup peas (cooked just tender), 3 eggs and
  sprouts. Also, just 1 clove garlic, which was heated with the ginger
  (discarded when brown) before cooking the chicken.
  *  I like to add 1/2 c red bell pepper (diced) for color.

      Title: SUPREMES DE VOLAILLE ROUGE ET VERT
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Chicken breast,
           -whole

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
           Juice of 1 lime
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 t  Ginger
      1    Garlic clove,
           -finely chopped
      1 pn Tarragon

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
           Juice of 1 lime
      3 oz White wine
           Butter (salted)
      3 oz Tomato paste
 
  Mix the marinade ingredients.  Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2
  supremes, and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Reserve bones.
  
  Cook a bouillon using the bones.  You will need about 3 oz of bouillon.
  
  Drain, flatten and flour the supremes.  Saute quickly in clarified butter,
  about two minutes on each side.  Remove and keep warm.
  
  Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste and bouillon.
  Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much. Remove from heat
  and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter. If you remove the sauce too soon, it
  will be too soupy. The sauce should be cinnamon-coloured and shiny. There
  will be very little sauce, you may need a rubber scraper to get it out of
  the pan.
  
  Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.
  
  Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients.  I have just
  strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that.  Wear a raincoat
  when making the sauce.  It splatters.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce -- This recipe was originally
  posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax. The French name
  means "boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce." I like it a lot.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  30 minutes marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CURRY CHICKEN WITH GRAPES
 Categories: Poultry, Salads, Usenet
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8    Chicken breast
           -halves (boned)
      6 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(or less; vary amount
           -to taste)
      2 c  Mayonnaise
      4 t  Curry powder
      3 t  Olive oil
      1 t  Cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Black pepper, ground
      1 t  Fruit vinegar
 
  Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken and
  the grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into the sauce and
  then eating it).
  
  Broil the chicken breasts (3-5 minutes on each side in a preheated
  broiler), then dice or shred into small bite-sized pieces.
  
  Mix chopped chicken with about 2 cups of whole grapes.  Cover with the
  sauce. Add more grapes to taste. My taste is to add vast quantities of
  grapes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken fruit salad curry -- One day I was invited to a beach picnic,
  and asked to bring a salad. A friend and I got together in his kitchen and
  concocted a curried chicken salad with grapes.  It was delicious, but we
  forgot to write down the recipe.  After some more experimentation, I have
  come up with this recipe. I don't know if it is the same as what we made
  that day at the beach, but it is delicious.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes including cooking the chicken.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: STIR-FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Stir-fry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
     12    Mushrooms (white)
    1/2 lb Broccoli, fresh
           -(or 1 pk frozen)
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      2 T  Soy sauce
      2 T  Sherry
      1 T  Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower oil
           -is good, too)
    1/2 t  Cornstarch
      6 oz Bamboo shoots, canned
           -(optional)
      6 oz Cashew nuts, broken
           -into large pieces
 
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.  Wash and slice the
  mushrooms.  If using fresh broccoli, wash and cut it up into bite-sized
  pieces.  If using frozen broccoli, heat it or partially thaw it first.
  
  Combine chicken broth, soy sauce, sherry and about 1 T cornstarch.  Stir
  well and set aside.
  
  Combine beaten egg white, salt, about 1/2 t oil and about 2 t cornstarch.
  Add the chicken cubes to the mixture and stir until the chicken is
  well-coated. In a wok or deep cast iron pan, heat about 3 T vegetable oil
  until hot. Add the chicken pieces in small batches and stir continuously
  until golden brown. After each batch is finished, remove and drain. Add oil
  sparingly as needed.
  
  Stir fry the mushrooms in the wok.  Stir fry the broccoli in the wok.
  Combine the chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, bamboo shoots and cashew nuts in
  the wok. Stir fry to get everything warm again. Add the bouillon-cornstarch
  sauce and stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese stir-fried chicken with broccoli and nuts.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  *  Bamboo shoots are available in cans at Chinese grocery stores.  Fresh
  broccoli is preferable to frozen, and it should be stir-fried for only a
  few minutes to keep it crunchy. Endless variations of this basic recipe are
  possible.  Beef, pork, or other lean meats can be substituted for the
  chicken. Tofu cubes or brown beans can be used to make this a vegetarian
  recipe. Chopped almonds can be used instead of cashews. Water chestnuts are
  a delightful addition. Green or red bell peppers can be used instead of
  broccoli.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: EASY SWEET AND SOUR CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken breast,
           -boneless
      1 t  Ginger, chopped
      1    Egg white
    1/2 t  Salt
      2 t  Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -(peanut oil is best,
           -but sunflower is
           -good, too)
      1    Green (bell) pepper
      6    Carrots
     12 oz Pineapple chunks, canned
           -(drained, but reserve
           -about 1/2 cup of
           -the juice)
           SAUCE
      2 t  Sherry
      2 t  Light soy sauce
      1 T  Vinegar
      1 t  Sugar
      1 T  Cornstarch
      1 t  Salt
 
  Cut up the chicken into bite-sized chunks.  Combine ginger, egg white,
  about 1/2 teaspoons each salt and cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon oil. Add
  the chicken chunks and stir until the chicken is well-coated.
  
  Wash green pepper.  Discard seeds and stem.  Cut into strips about 1 x 1/4
  inches.  Peel carrots.  If they are thick, cut in half lengthwise.  Cut
  diagonally into pieces about 1 inch long.  Cook the carrots in boiling
  water for 3-5 minutes, depending how crunchy you like your carrots.
  
  Drain pineapple chunks, saving about 1/2 cup of the juice.  Prepare the
  sweet and sour sauce by mixing sherry, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, reserved
  pineapple juice, about 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and about 1 teaspoon salt.
  Stir well and set aside.
  
  Heat about 3 tablespoon of oil very hot in a wok or deep cast iron pan.
  Peanut oil is best since it has a high smoking point.  Stir-fry the chicken
  by putting a small batch (e.g., 5 pieces) of the cubed chicken in the wok
  and stirring continuously until golden brown. Remove to a dish. Repeat
  until all the chicken has been cooked, adding small amounts of oil as it
  gets used up.
  
  Heat about 1 tablespoon oil in an empty wok.  Stir fry the parboiled
  carrots and the green pepper for 30 seconds. Add the chicken and the
  pineapple chunks to the vegetables in the wok. Stir 1 minute or until well
  mixed and reheated. Add sweet and sour sauce to wok. Stir until thickened.
  
  Serve with rice.  I serve this recipe to company all the time and am amazed
  at how many people don't realize that you can cook Chinese food at home. It
  is always a big hit. The recipe works equally well with lean pork, tofu
  cubes, or soy beans instead of the chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A nice Chinese dinner you can make at home -- Don't forget to start
  cooking the rice so it will be done at the same time as the chicken.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the sauce ingredients.

      1    Green bell pepper
      1    Red bell pepper
      1 lb Chicken breast,

-----------------------------------BATTER-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Baking powder,
           -double-acting
    1/2 t  Vegetable oil

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1    Lemon
      3 T  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
      1 t  Cornstarch
      2 t  Water
           Parsley sprigs
 
  Wash and seed the peppers.  Cut each one into strips about 2 x 1/4 inches.
  Cut the boneless chicken breast into strips about 3 x 1/2 inches.
  
  Prepare the batter by mixing in a bowl the flour, cornstarch, baking
  powder, salt, water and oil. Stir until smooth.
  
  Cut half of the lemon into thin semicircular slices.  Prepare the lemon
  sauce by squeezing the juice from the other half of the lemon and combining
  in a cup with the sugar and water. Stir well.
  
  Combine about 1 teaspoon cornstarch and about 2 teaspoon water in a second
  cup.  This mixture will be used later to thicken the lemon sauce.  Dip each
  piece of chicken in the batter and let the excess drip back into the bowl.
  
  Deep fry the chicken in small batches.  It is best to use an electric deep
  fryer, but if this is not available, heat about 1 quart of vegetable oil in
  a wok or deep pan until it is very hot. Then add about 5 pieces of chicken
  at a time to the oil and cook, covered, for about 5 minutes or until a
  golden brown crust forms. Check once a minute to see if the pieces are
  sticking together, and if so, separate them. After each batch is finished,
  set aside on a paper towel to drain off the excess oil.
  
  Cook the lemon sauce by pouring the lemon-sugar mixture into a saucepan and
  bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-water mixture and stir until
  thickened.
  
  To please the eye as well as the palate, mix up the chicken and colored
  pepper pieces and pile on a plate. Top with sprigs of parsley and place the
  lemon slices around the outside of the plate. Put the hot lemon sauce in a
  cup so that people can pour it over their chicken just before eating, to
  keep it crispy.
  
  Serve with rice.  Don't forget to start the rice so that it will be done at
  the same time as the chicken.
  
  A nice-looking dish for company.  The deep-fried chicken pieces can also be
  served as party snacks instead of junk food.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Crispy chunks of chicken in sweet lemon sauce.  Yield:  Serves 2-3.
  
  : Difficulty:  With an electric deep fryer, easy; without one, moderate.
  : Time:  45 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the batter ingredients.

      Title: QUICK MACADAMIA CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Garlic clove, pressed
      4    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/4 t  Dill
    1/2    Sweet red pepper
    1/4 lb Green beans (optional)
      1 lg Tomato
    1/8 lb Macadamia nuts
      4 T  Honey
    1/8 t  Sesame seeds
           Sesame oil
 
  Slice or chop all ingredients.  Saute the garlic in the sesame oil, until
  just fragrant. Add the dill and the chicken, and saute for about five
  minutes. Add the green beans and the red pepper; saute for another couple
  of minutes. Add the tomato and the macadamia nuts; saute another minute or
  two.  Add the honey and the sesame seeds. Continue cooking just long enough
  to warm the honey.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised this
  recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and it's very quick.
  
  *  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken broth
  when cooking the couscous.
  
  *  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about 1/4 t
  arrowroot, or some cornstarch.

      Title: GREAT GRAPE CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Chicken breasts, halved,
           -boned, skinned (6 halves,
           -about 3 lb in all)
      2 T  Butter (or margarine)
      1 T  Orange marmalade (I suggest
           -fresh coarsely-grated
           -orange peel)
    1/4 t  Tarragon, crumbled
    1/3 c  White wine, dry
      1    Green onion,
           -thinly sliced (use
           -part of the top)
      1 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(try red grapes,
           -such as "Flame")
    1/4 c  Cream, whipping
           Salt
           Nutmeg
 
  Sprinkle chicken breasts with salt and nutmeg.  Brown lightly in heated
  butter in a large frying pan. Add marmalade, tarragon, green onion and
  wine. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Add grapes, cover again and continue cooking about 10 minutes longer, until
  chicken is cooked through (test with a small, sharp knife in thickest
  part).
  
  Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken and grapes to a warm serving dish;
  keep warm. Add cream to liquid in pan. Bring to boiling, stirring, and cook
  until reduced and slightly thickened. Salt to taste. Pour sauce over
  chicken.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken in wine with grapes and orange -- This recipe was originally
  posted by Wayne Thompson. I thought it was great, and I submit it here with
  some variations. This colors in this dish are a feast for the eyes. The
  recipe comes originally from "Elegant Meals with Inexpensive Meats," by
  Ortho Books. Yield: Serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  (WT) I use a whole cut up chicken.
  
  *  (CSR) I like to cook the chicken in a black cast-iron pan; I skip the
  cream sauce, because it smothers the beautiful black-green-red-orange-tan
  colors.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MICRONESIAN CHICKEN
 Categories: Bar-b-q, Poultry, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Chicken breasts
           -(leave bones and
           -skin intact)
      3    Lemons
      1 md Onion, chopped
     12 oz Beer
      4 oz Soy sauce
      1    Garlic clove,
           -mashed or chopped
 
  Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
  preparing the rest of the marinade.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and chopped
  garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.
  
  Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours minimum.
  It's better to marinate overnight.  Make sure chicken is covered by
  marinade.
  
  Over an OPEN outdoor grill (gas or charcoal), cook the chicken for about 40
  minutes turning every 10 minutes or so.  Each time the chicken is turned,
  re- dip the pieces in the marinade.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy marinated chicken for outdoor BBQ -- This recipe was obtained from
  a friend of a friend several years ago. It has been a hit every time and is
  guaranteed to have your downwind neighbors salivating at your doorstep.
  Yield:  serves 2-4.
  
  *  More chicken may be added to this recipe; the only limiting factor is
  that the chicken be covered with the marinade while in the refrigerator.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes to prepare marinade, overnight in refrigerator, 40
  minutes to cook.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHICKEN WITH CHIPPED BEEF AND BACON
 Categories: Entrees, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Chicken breast halves
           -(4 whole breasts)
      4 oz Chipped beef
           -(1 package)
      8 sl Bacon
     13 oz Mushroom soup
           -concentrate (e.g.
           -1 can Campbell's soup)
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Cut chipped beef into strips.  Line the baking pan with them.
  
  Wrap bacon around chicken.  Put in pan on top of beef.
  
  Mix soup and sour cream.  Pour mixture over chicken.  Cover tightly and
  refrigerate overnight, or at least several hours.  It comes out better if
  you do it overnight.
  
  Bake in 275 degree F. oven, uncovered, for three hours.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Succulent and easy chicken -- This recipe makes the most succulent and
  juicy chicken I've had.  It is very easy to make.  The only drawback is
  that you have to start the night before you want to serve it. It would be a
  good recipe for when you have company, since you can do most of the work
  the previous day.
  
  *  A note on ingredients for non-US cooks:  "chipped beef" is cooked spiced
  beef cut into very thin slices and packaged for sandwiches.  A worthy
  substitute is  roast beef sliced very thin and seasoned lightly with salt
  and pepper. A "can of mushroom soup," such as Campbell's soup, is 1 1/2
  cups of double-strength cream soup concentrate. You can substitute the
  Knorr Swiss dried mushroom soup mix (available worldwide) if you make it
  with a mixture of milk and water. Use 1/2 of a 70-gram package of soup mix
  with 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk. Cook the soup according to package
  directions, then let cool.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 day waiting, 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: CHICKEN KORMA
 Categories: Poultry, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Chicken breast
           -halves, boned
    1/2 c  Safflower oil
    1/4 c  Butter, clarified
           -(the Indians call
           -this stuff "ghee")
      6 md Yellow onions
      3    Cloves garlic, fresh
  1 1/2 t  Ginger (use fresh
           -ginger if you can
           -find it)
     20    Cloves, whole
     12    Green cardamom seeds,
           -whole, cracked
           -(or less; or use 2 t
           -of ground cardamom)
      5    Bay leaves
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 t  Coriander (ground)
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
           -(or more to taste)
      8 oz Yogurt, plain
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Cut the chicken breasts into bite-size pieces and set aside.  Peel the
  onions and chop them fine. You should have about 3 cups of onion. Mince the
  garlic and add to the bowl of chopped onions.
  
  In a big frypan that has a lid, heat the butter and oil, then saute the
  onions and garlic for about 10 minutes, until the first hint of browning.
  Use "medium-high" heat.
  
  Crack the cardamom seeds between your fingers, just to get the shell open.
  Add them to the pan.  Add the ginger, cloves, bay leaves and salt.  Saute
  until the onions are nice and brown, about 5 more minutes.
  
  Mix the coriander and red pepper with the yogurt.  Add the yogurt to the
  frypan, stirring as you pour, slowly enough that the onion doesn't stop
  bubbling.  It could take several minutes to do this, depending on the
  diameter of your frypan. When the last of the yogurt dries up, add the
  chicken pieces and brown them. Add 1/2 cup water, reduce heat, cover and
  simmer 20 minutes.
  
  Stir in the milk and turn off the heat.  It needs to sit a few minutes to
  let the flavors blend. The longer you let it sit after cooking, the better
  it will taste (up to several hours).
  
  While the chicken is sitting, cook some rice.  I make saffron rice to go
  with this dish.
  
  Fish out the bay leaves and as many of the whole cloves as you can find,
  before serving.  Americans don't seem to like to eat whole cloves in their
  food.  Check to make sure it is moist enough (it should have the
  consistency of applesauce). Reheat over low heat. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Indian braised chicken with onions, cloves and ginger -- I learned to
  like Indian food in London, where delicious Indian food can be had in
  simple restaurants at hamburger prices and the fare at fancy places ranks
  among the finest food on Earth. Back in America, to satisfy my new craving
  for good Indian food I had to learn to cook it myself. This is a
  Friday-night supper dish in our family, too complex for a weekday meal, and
  too plain to serve to company.
  
  Indian food is often quite elaborate, so by their standards this is a fast
  and simple dish. It is a classical Indian recipe, found in many cookbooks.
  
  *  Indians put a lot more salt in their cooking than this recipe calls for;
  if you want to make it more authentic you should double the salt. Indians
  also don't like chicken skin and will go to great lengths to prevent even
  small pieces of chicken skin from getting into the food. I rather like
  chicken skin myself, and I don't try very hard to keep it out of this dish.
  
  *  If you can't find green cardamom seeds, don't bother using white ones,
  they've been bleached and processed and don't have much flavor left.  Use
  ground cardamom instead.

      Title: CHICKEN VINDALOO
 Categories: Poultry, Indian, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 t  Cumin seeds, whole
      1 t  Peppercorns, black
      1 t  Cardamom seeds
           Cinnamon
           -(3 in stick)

      5 T  White wine vinegar
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Cayenne pepper
      1 t  Brown sugar, light
     10 T  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Yellow onions,
           -peeled and cut

      1 T  Coriander seeds, ground
    1/2 t  Turmeric, ground
      2 lb Chicken breast
           -(boneless), cut into
           -bite-sized pieces
      8 oz Tomato sauce
    1/2 lb New potatoes,
           -peeled and quartered
 
  Grind cumin seeds, black pepper, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black mustard
  seeds and fenugreek seeds together in a spice grinder. In a small bowl,
  combine ground spices, vinegar, salt, cayenne pepper and brown sugar. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Fry onions, stirring
  frequently, until they are a rich, dark brown. Remove onions with a slotted
  spoon and put them in a blender. Turn off the heat, but do not discard the
  oil.  Add about 3 T water (or more if necessary) to the onions and blend
  until you have a smooth paste. Add this onion paste to the spices in the
  bowl.  This mixture is the vindaloo paste.
  
  Put the ginger and garlic in a blender.  Add about 3 T water and blend
  until you have a smooth paste.
  
  Heat the remaining oil in the saucepan over medium heat.  When hot, add the
  ginger, garlic paste.  Stir until the paste browns slightly.  Add the
  coriander and turmeric.  Stir a few seconds.  Add the chicken, a little at
  a time, and brown lightly.
  
  Add the vindaloo paste, tomato sauce and potatoes to the chicken in the
  saucepan.  Stir and bring to a slight boil.  Cover the saucepan, reduce
  heat to low and simmer for about an hour, or until potatoes are tender.
  Serve over rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spicy chicken curry -- Nearly every Indian restaurant serves something
  that it calls Chicken Vindaloo, but the dish varies greatly from place to
  place. This recipe is a modification of a vindaloo recipe that appears in
  Madhur Jaffrey's "Indian Cooking" (Barron's 1983). I've attempted to
  approximate the Chicken Vindaloo served at The Tandoor Palace on Second
  Avenue in New York. Yield: serves 4-6.
  
  *  Don't undercook the onions.  They should be cooked until dark brown.  If
  the onion paste turns out gray rather than brown, then the onions were not
  cooked enough.
  
  *  This dish is very, very hot.  It may not seem so at first, but the
  spices have a cumulative effect that builds up over the course of the meal.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 to 3 hours cooking.

      8 oz Fettucine
 
  Snip the tomatoes into bite-size pieces.  Melt the butter in a saucepan
  over low heat; add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add 3/4 cup of the
  stock and the tomatoes.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer,
  uncovered, over medium heat for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes are
  tender.  Add the cream and bring to a boil, stirring. Simmer over medium
  heat until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. (The
  sauce can be kept, covered, for 1 day in the refrigerator. Heat again over
  low heat.)
  Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.  Heat the oil in a
  large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken and saute,
  pressing on the chicken occasionally with a slotted spatula, for about 4
  minutes per side or until the meat feels springy and is no longer pink
  inside (cut to check).  Transfer to a board; cover and keep warm.
  
  Discard the fat from the skillet.  Add the remaining stock and bring to a
  boil, stirring up the pan juices.  Boil to reduce slightly, then add to the
  sauce.  Stir in the basil.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.
  Meanwhile, cook the pasta, uncovered, in a large port of boiling salted
  water over high heat, stirring occasionally (about 1 to 2 minutes for fresh
  or 3 to 5 minutes for dried fettucine), or until tender but firm to the
  bite (al dente).  Drain, transfer to bowl and toss with 3 or 4 tablespoons
  of the sauce.
  Cut each chicken breasts into 2 or 3 diagonal slices.  Reheat gently in the
  sauce if needed.  Transfer the pasta to serving plates, top with the
  chicken and coat with sauce.

  same dish as you will use to complete the dish.  I use Pepperidge
  Farm stuffing mix.) Put chicken breasts in baking dish, sprinkle with
  pepper. Top chicken with cheese slice, then ham slice, then stuffing
  mix. Cover and micro on medium-high (70%) 15 minutes, rotating dish
  three times. Uncover, top with chicken gravy, microcook on high to
  heat.
