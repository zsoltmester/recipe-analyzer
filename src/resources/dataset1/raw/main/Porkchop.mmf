      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
    3/4 t  Garlic powder
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Dry mustard
    1/2 t  Rubbed sage
    1/2 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves

---------------------------PORK CHOP INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      6 ea 1-3/4" thick pork chops
    3/4 lb Ground pork
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers
      2 t  Minced garlic
      1 cn (4 oz) diced green chilies
      1 c  Pork or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Very fine bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions
 
  In a food processor or blender, process the apples, 4 Tablespoons
  of the butter, the sugar, vanilla and nutmeg until smooth, about
  3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.
    In a small bowl thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients;
  set aside.
    Prepare the pork chops by cutting a large pocket (to the bone)
  into the larger side of each chop to hold the stuffing.
    In a large skillet, brown the ground pork in the remaining 3 Tbsp.
  butter over high heat, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers,
  garlic, and 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning mix, stirring well; cook about
  5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom well.  Stir
  in the green chilies and their juice and continue cooking until
  mixture is well browned, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally
  and scraping the pan bottom as needed.  Add the stock and cook 5
  minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook
  about 2 minutes more, stirring constantly and scraping pan bottom
  as needed.  Remove from heat.
    Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mix evenly on both sides of the
  chops and inside the pockets, pressing it in by hand.  Prop chops
  with pocket side up in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.  Spoon
  about 1/4 cup stuffing into each pocket; reserve the remaining
  stuffing.  Bake chops with pocket up at 400F until the meat is
  done, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Place the remaining stuffing in a
  small pan in the oven for the last 20 minutes to reheat.
    Serve immediately with each chop arranged on top of a portion
  of the remaining stuffing.

      Title: BLACKENED PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     18    5 oz pork chops, 3/4" thick
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter (note

-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      1 T  Salt
      1 T  + 2 tsp white pepper
      1 T  + 3/4 tsp black pepper
  2 1/2 t  Dry mustard
  2 1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
      2 t  Garlic powder
    3/4 t  Dried thyme leaves
 
  NOTE:  The 3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, must
  be kept melted and warm in the skillet.
  Let the chops come to room remperature before
  blackening.  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients
  thoroughly in a medium-size bowl.    Heat a large
  cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  extremely hot and just short of the point at which you
  see white ash or a white spot forming in the skillet
  bottom, about 8 minutes.  (The time will vary
  according to the intensity of the heat source.)
     Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.    Just
  before cooking each chop, dip it in the melted butter
  so that both sides are well coated, then sprinkle each
  side generously and evenly with the seasoning mix (use
  between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon on each side), patting it
  in with your hands.  (If you lay the chop on a plate
  or other surface to season it, be sure the surface is
  warm so the butter won't congeal and stick to the
  surface instead of to the chop.  Wipe the surface
  clean after seasoning each chop.  Use any remnaining
  seasoning mix in another recipe.)    Immediately place
  the chop in the hot skillet.  If the chop is very
  lean, pour about 1 teaspoon butter on top.  (Be
  careful, as the butter may flame up.)  If you cook
  more than 1 chop at a time, place each chop in the
  skillet before buttering and seasoning another one.
     Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the
  underside forms a crust, about 2 minutes (the time
  will vary according to the thickness of the chops and
  the heat of the skillet or fire).  Turn the chops over
  and pour about 1 teaspoon more butter on top of each,
  if needed.  Cook just until meat is done, about 2
  minutes more.  Serve the chops crustier side up while
  piping hot.    Clean the skillet after cooking each
  batch and repeat the blackening procedure with the
  remaining chops.    To serve, place 2 or 3 chops on
  each heated serving plate.  If you use a serving
  plater, DO NOT STACK THE CHOPS. From The Prudhome
  Family Cookbook Some personal notes:  If you do not
  have a heavy duty commercial range hood, capable of
  disposing of an incredible amount of smoke, DON'T cook
  this inside.  If you live in an apartment, like I do,
  where your smoke detector is attached to a central
  fire system, you will very quickly become well known
  to all your neighbors, and your local firefighters. In
  all likelyhood you will also get to meet your
  landlord.    A good, 40,000 BTU to 50,000 BTU barbecue
  will do a good job of providing sufficient heat.  Be
  sure you have all your doors and windows closed, and
  invite your neighbors to the barbecue.  This method
  generates a totally unbelievable amount of smoke.
   However, the results are worth it.  Whatever you are
  cooking by this method, it is an entirely incredible
  taste experience. From Prudhomme Family Cookbook

    1/2 c  Cooked small peas
           Parsley bouquets for garnish
 
  Pour oil into a large skillet.  Heat and brown chicken pieces; remove to
  casserole, which should measure 14 inches in diameter.  Brown cubed pork
  and lamb chops in skillet and remove to casserole.  To the drippings, add
  the onion and the green pepper.  Saute until onion is transparent.  Add the
  garlic, bay leaf, and finely chopped tomato.  Stir to mix and cook 5
  minutes.  Combine the toasted saffron, 2 cups of hot broth, salt, and hot
  sauce.  Stir into skillet; bring to a boil, then pour over meat and chicken
  in casserole.  Again bring to a boil, lower heat, cover, and cook until the
  meat is tender (30 minutes).  Now, add shrimp, scallops, oysters, cubed red
  snapper, scrubbed clams, lobster meat, stone crab claws, and squids (remove
  part of the ink of the squids and chop squids coarsely). Cook approximately
  15 minutes at moderate heat, or until the shellfish turn pink. Remove stone
  crab claws for later use.  Half the shell of the clams may be removed if
  desired.  There should be enough liquid in casserole to measure about 3-1/2
  cups; add more broth if necessary. Stir in the 2 cups of rice and mix well
  to distribute evenly in csserole. When it starts to boil, add the 1/2 cup
  wine.  Cover the casserole and place in preheated 325 degree F oven for 20
  minutes. Meanwhile cook artichokes according to direction on package. Drain
  and use only 6 to 8 perfect ones. Five minutes before removing casserole
  from oven, uncover and place artichokes around edge of casserole. Place the
  asparagus spears in between artichokes cartwheel fashion.  Place the stone
  crab claws in decorative arrangement around the casserole.  Cut 1 pimiento
  in strips and place over the rice.  Fill the remaining pimiento with peas
  and place in center of casserole, pressing down to avoid toppling over. Add
  parsley bouquets here and there for color.  Sprinkle all with dry sherry
  and return to oven uncovered for 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven and let
  stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. NOTE: In many parts of Spain,
  a lemon wedge to squeeze over the paella is served with each portion.

    1/2 c  Sauterne
     12 oz Beer
 
  1. In a large non-aluminum (preferably glass or glazed cast iron)
     bowl make a marinade by combining the burgundy, thyme, bay leaves,
     garlic, and black pepper. Place all the beef in the bowl and mix
     lightly to coat the meat well. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
     (If time is short marinate for 2 hours at room temperature.)
  
  2. Place the chicken breasts in a saucepan with enough water to
     cover. Add 1 teaspoon salt and simmer over low heat for 1/2 hour.
     Remove the chicken reserving the liquid. Chop the chicken breasts
     fine and reserve.
  
  3. Meal the oil in a large heavy pot. Add the onions and cook until
     they are translucent.
  
  4. Meanwhile, drain the beef, straining and reserving the marinade.
     Mix the beef and pork together, then combine the meats with the
     ground chile, cayenne pepper, oregano, cumin, rosemary, and the
     rest of the salt.  Add this meat-and-spice mixture to the pot with
     the onions. Break up any lumps with a fork and cook, stirring
     occasionally, until the meat is evenly browned.
  
  5. Add half the marinade, the reserved chicken, tomatoes, both tomato

     the pot.
  
  6. Melt the butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the fresh
     chiles, mushrooms, and a small amount of the Sauterne and cook for
     3 minutes. Add this to the pot.
  
  7. Bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for at least 3 hours. When
     the chili is cooking, from time to time stir in the remaining
     marinade, the remaining Sauterne, and beer. If more liquid is
     needed, stir in the water the chicken was cooked in. Taste and
     adjust seasonings.

  listed may be all right for your family.)     Nancy

  I saw this in Parade Magazine the other day. Don't have time to make this.
  Probably time consuming but enjoyable to make if you have the time or the
  weather (who wants to be indoors cooking in the Summer?) Don't make this
  for the creep who puts ketchup on everything. Wouldn't it be annoying after
  spending so much time cooking someone throws some unwanted condiment onto
  the food? Enjoy!!

    1/2 ts Garlic, minced
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, diced
    1/2 c  Parsley, minced
      1 ts Caraway seeds
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      4    Loin pork chops

      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
    3/4 c  Chicken broth
 
  1. Preheat the oven to 300. Put the bread cubes in a baking dish and
  place in the oven. Bake about 5 min. or until lightly brown. 2.
  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan and add 1 cup of the chopped
  onion, the garlic and the mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until wilted.
  Spoon the mixture into a mixing bowl and add the parsley, caraway
  seeds, bread cubes and egg. Stir well. 3. Holding a knife parallel to
  the surface of the meat, split each chop in half to the bone, top to
  bottom, but do not cut entirely through. Place the flaps of each chop
  on a flat surface and pound with a mallet. Do not break the flesh or
  the stuffing will ooze out. Stuff each chop with equal portions of
  stuffing. Fold the flaps together to enclose the stuffing and secure
  with wooden toothpicks. 4. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large
  enough to hold the chops in one layer without crowding. Add the chops
  and cook over moderately high heat about 4 min on each side until
  well browned. Continue cooking, turning occasionally, about 15 min.
  Transfer the chops to a hot serving dish and keep warm. 5. Pour off
  the fat from the skillet and add the remaining onion. Cook, stirring,
  about 1 min. then add the vinegar and stir well. Add the broth and
  bring to a boil, stirring. 6. Remove the toothpicks from the chops.
  Srain the sauce, pushing through the sieve as much of the solids as
  possible, and serve.

  from the California Culinary Academy over in the city and comprise a
  soul food dinner.
  
  No matter where they're served, smothered meat dishes are extremely
  popular (and remarkably similar) throughout the South:  chops heaped
  high with sauteed onions and a spicy brown gravy.  This
  Mississippi/Louisiana recipe borrows several New Orleans Creole
  techniques.
  
  1.  In a small saucepan melt butter over medium-high heat, stir in
  the 2 tablespoons flour, and cook, stirring constantly with a wire
  whisk, until lightly browned.  Stir in broth and sage, mix well,
  remove from heat, and set aside.  This mixture will be the sauce.
  
  2.  Add salt and pepper to the 1 cup flour; dredge chops in the
  mixture. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4 cup of the lard over
  medium- high heat. Add chops and cook until they are browned.  Move
  browned chops to a large, oven proof casserole with a cover.  Preheat
  oven to 350F.
  
  3.  Melt the remaining lard in skillet over high heat.  Add onions,
  garlic, and celery; lower heat to medium, and cook, stirring
  frequently to avoid burning, until onions are golden (about 8 to 10
  minutes). Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and place over chops
  in the casserole.
  
  4.  Pour off all lard from the skillet.  Add reserved sauce, raise
  heat to high, bring to a boil, and cook for 1 minute, stirring
  vigorously and scraping the bottom of the skillet.  Pour sauce over
  chops in casserole, cover, and bake for 30 minutes.  Serve with
  mashed potatoes.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: SOUTHERN STYLE PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Meats, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Pork chops,
           -about 1/2 inch
           Shortening or oil
      4    Onion slices (we
           -like these fairly thick)
    1/4 c  Peanut butter
    1/4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Mushroom soup, condensed
           -(or make a mushroom-
           -flavored white sauce)
      1 t  Worcestershire sauce
      1 t  Salt
    1/8 t  Black pepper
 
  In a frying pan big enough to hold all of the chops at once,  brown pork
  chops on both sides in a little shortening or oil. Pour off fat, leaving
  chops in frying pan. Place an onion slice on top of each chop.
  
  Mix peanut butter, mushroom soup, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt and
  pepper. Pour over chops. Cover and simmer over medium to low heat for 45
  minutes. You may want to move the chops around in the pan from time to time
  to keep them from sticking.
  
  Smooth peanut butter is best.  The chunky variety gives a strange
  consistency to this dish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pork chops in mushroom peanut-butter sauce -- I originally found this
  recipe in the "Woman's Day Encyclopedia of Cookery."  It is very easy to
  prepare and makes a hearty main dish served over rice or noodles.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes browning, 45 minutes simmering.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.
