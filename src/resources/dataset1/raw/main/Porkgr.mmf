      Title: CAJUN MEAT LOAF
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      2 ea Whole bay leaves
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
      1 t  Black pepper
    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 t  Ground cumin
    1/2 t  Ground nutmeg

------------------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS------------------------------
      4 T  Unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Finely chopped onions
    1/2 c  Green bell peppers, chopped
    1/4 c  Green onions, finely chopped
      2 t  Minced garlic
      1 T  Tabasco sauce
      1 T  Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 c  Evaporated milk
    1/2 c  Catsup
  1 1/2 lb Ground beef
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      2 ea Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 c  Very fine bread crumbs
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions,
  celery, bell peppers, green onions, garlic, tabasco, Worcestershire and
  seasoning mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6
  minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in
  the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room
  temperature.
  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add
  the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the
  bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the
  pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6
  inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes,
  then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes
  longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.
  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives
  more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.

    meat seasoning mix.  Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
    frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and
    cool.  Add the sauteed vegetable mixture and 1/4 cup of the milk to
    the meat and mix well by hand.  Form into a 12x8-inch loaf and center
    in the pan.  Bake at 450F until brown on top, about 30 minutes.
    Remove from oven; pour off drippings, reserve 2-1/2 tablespoons.  Set
    meat and drippings aside.    Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork
    tender; drain, reserving about 1 cup of the water.  Place the
    potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing bowl with the remaining 1
    stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white pepper.  Stir with a
    wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal whisk (or
    electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.  (NOTE:
    Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
    enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the
    reserved drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning
    mix; saute over high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the
    zucchini and yellow squash and continue sauteing until vegetables are
    noticeably brighter in color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
    occasionally.  Remove from heat.    Mound undrained vegetables on top
    of the meat loaf, away from the edges.  Layer the mashed potatoes
    evenly over the top of the vegetables and top edges of the meat, using
    all the potatoes.  Bake at 525F until brown on top, about 8 to 10
    minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun Sauce
    (see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana
    Kitchen"

 Categories: Pork, Poultry, Soups, Oriental
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Zucchini, Medium Size.
  1 1/2 c  Lean Ground Pork or Chicken.
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten.
      2 T  Fish Sauce.
           Ground White Peppers.
      2 T  Cilantro, chopped.
      6 c  Chicken or Pork Stock.
 
  Peel zucchini and cut into approximately 1-1/2" lengths.  Make the lengths
  of zucchini into cups by scooping out the seeds in the center, but leaving
  small amount to form the bottom of the cup.  You may need more or less
  zucchini than the amount given, depending on their size.
  In a bowl, mix the ground pork or chicken with fish sauce, eggs, ground
  white peppers, and cilantro.  Fill the zucchini cups with the mixture, and
  overfill slightly to make a small mound.  Cook the filled zucchini cups by
  steaming for about 1/2 hour.
  Bring the chicken or pork stock to a boil, and season to taste.  Place the
  precooked zucchini cups into a serving tureen, pour the boiling stock
  over them, and serve.

  edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes per side. Drain them
  on paper towels, then keep them warm on an uncovered platter in a 250F
  oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes, adding more vegetable oil to the
  skillet if needed. Serve the pancakes hot with the dipping sauce.

  IN SEPARATE MEDIUM BOWLS, soak the mung bean noodles and tree-ear mushrooms
  with water until soft and pliable. Drain the noodles and cut into shorter
  lengths; set aside. Remove the hard centers from the mushrooms, coarsely
  chop and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the pork, garlic, fish sauce
  and ground pepper. Mix in crab meat, tree-ear mushrooms, carrots, bean
  sprouts, shallots and bean thread noodles; set aside. Combine the warm
  water and sugar in a bowl. Lay 1 rice paper wrapper on a damp towel. (Keep
  unused wrappers in their package.) Generously brush it with the sugar
  water; allow it to soften to a very pliable wrapper, about 30 seconds or
  sometime longer (depending upon the brand). With your hands shape 3
  tablespoons filling into a tight compact 1-inch-wide-by-4-to-5-inch-long
  cylinder. Place cylinder along the lower edge of wrapper. Roll the bottom
  up and over the roll tightly. Fold both outside edges inward to enclose the
  ends. Continue rolling up into a cylinder; set aside covered with plastic
  wrap. Repeat until all the rolls are done. To cook and brown evenly, the
  roll must be firm and evenly packed. If the wrapper has a tear, bandage it
  with a softened rice-paper remnant. In a preheated wok or saucepan, add oil
  to a depth of 2 inches and heat to 325F. Add a few rolls at a time, but do

      Title: BROWN 'N' SERVE SAUSAGE
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork
    1/4 c  Cracker crumbs
    1/4 c  Water
      1 ts Sage
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Ground cloves
 
  The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.
  
  Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt, thyme,
  oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined.
  
  Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
  patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.)  Place in a cold,
  lightly oiled frypan.
  
  Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
  beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.
  
  Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in
  refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months.  Or cook a second
  time and serve immediately.
  
  To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook over
  medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages are brown
  and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner, allowing about 2 min
  longer for cooking.
  
  Each sausage or patty - 59 calories, 1 protein choice 1 g carbohydrate, 7 g
  protein, 3 g fat.

  Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the frying
  pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the fat and blot
  with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking dish (try 8"
  pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top with about 2 1/4 cups
  seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until crumbs are lightly browned.
  
  1/12 recipe = 10 grams carbohydrate, 9 grams protein, 4 grams fat, 113
  calories.  Compare with 1/12 recipe Betty Crocker Pork Pies made with 1 lb
  sausage and 1 c cooked ham, cream of chicken soup, apples, pastry: 19.5 gm
  carbohydrate, 10 gm protein, 15 grams fat, 250 calories.

      Title: CHINESE: STEAMED TRANSLUCENT DUMPLING - FUN G
 Categories: Dumplings, Chinese, Appetizers, Ethnic
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      6    Dried Chinese black
           -mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled and deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           -chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           -sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
 
  These dumplings make great finger food for a cocktail party. They can be
  prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before serving. The
  wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a unique
  translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll out the wrappers
  as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
  Wheat Starch Wrappers (see recipe) Vegetable oil Light soy sauce, for
  dipping Chinese mustard, for dipping
  
  Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and pliable.
  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off the stems
  at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
  Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well with
  cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
  Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium- high
  heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling
  to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
  Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of dough.
  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle. An oiled
  Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press or a
  rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of the
  circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling inside.
  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
  Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

  finer than hamburger.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling skin. Then
  bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much as possible,
  without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need, with
  the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming 10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.
  
  *  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are round
  and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by merely cutting
  off the corners to round off the skin.

  Bake in moderate oven (375 degrees) for 30 minutes.  Brush loaf with
  catsup.  Bake 25 minutes or until cooked through.  Let stand 10 minute
  before slicing.
  
  Judi's Notes:  I would bake this meat loaf in a loaf pan due to possible
  grease escaping from the jelly roll pan.  I would also spoon off some of
  the fat from the loaf after 30 minutes.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5    Cloves garlic, peeled
    1/4 c  Water
      1 lb Ground chuck
    2/3 lb Coarsely ground pork
      1 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, whole
    1/2 ts Dried basil
    1/2 c  Beef stock
 
  Crush the garlic well in the water, using a fork. Stir the meat,
  baking soda, seasonings, and garlic puree together. Add Beef Stock
  and mix well. For each sausage, take 1/3 cup of the meat mixture, and
  roll between the palms of your hands into a sausage shape about 4
  inches long. Place sausages side by side in a container and cover.
  Refrigerate overnight so that the flavors can blend.
  These are excellent on the grill. They may also be broiled or baked
  in the oven. Broil the sausages about 3 minutes per side until cooked
  through and browned..
  HINT: When hand rolling sausages or meatballs of any kind, keep a
  small bowl of water near you so that you can keep your hands a bit
  wet. This way the meat will not stick to your hands.

      1 oz Each cooked ground pork and
           -cooked shrimp
    1/4 c  Finely chopped scallions
    1/4 c  Finely shredded Chinese
           -cabbage
      2 ts Reduced-sodium soy sauce
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
     20    Wonton wrappers (3 x 3-inch
           -squares)
      1 tb Peanut oil
      2 ts Reduced-calorie margarine
      2 tb Teriyaki sauce

      2 ts Each hoisin sauce
           -and rice vinegar
 
  WONTONS:  In medium bowl combine pork, shrimp, scallions, cabbage, soy
  sauce, cornstarch and ginger, mixing well.  Spoon an equal amount of pork
  mixture (about 1 teaspoon) onto the center of each wonton wrapper; moisten
  edges of wrappers with water and fold wrappers in half, triangle- fashion,
  enclosing filling and forming 20 wontons.  Press edges together to seal;
  bring base corners of each triangle together, overlapping corners, and
  press to seal.  In 12-inch nonstick skillet or a wok, combine oil and
  margarine and heat, over high heat, until margarine is bubbly and hot; add
  wontons and cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides. Add
  teriyaki sauce and bring to a boil, stirring to coat wontons. Use slotted
  spoon to remove wontons to serving plate, reserving pan drippings. Set
  wontons aside and keep warm.
  DIPPING SAUCE:  To same skillet (or wok) add the ingredients for dipping
  sauce and stir to combine with pan drippings.  Pour sauce into small bowl
  and serve with wontons.
  Makes 4 servings of 5 wontons each.

      Title: PUSIT RELLENO
 Categories: Mexican, Seafood
      Yield: 6 servings
 
------------------------------STUFFED CALAMARI------------------------------
     12 lg Squids
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      3    Green onions, finely sliced
      1    Egg, beaten
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1 md Tomato, chopped
    1/2    Bay leaf
      1 tb Soy sauce
 
  Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and inside.
  Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside.
  In a large bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a little
  salt and pepper.
  Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and slippery, don't
  over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell when cooking. A pastry
  bag makes this easier to do.
  Place a pan in a steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15 minutes,
  or until filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside.
  Prepare sauce while steaming calamari.  In a skillet over medium heat,
  saute garlic in oil until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1 minute.
  Add tomato, bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomato
  pieces are soft.
  Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari.  Serve with rice.
  Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir fry
  them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from steaming the
  calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good dish to serve to
  people who don't like calamari or are a bit squeamish.
  Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm and green.

      3 tb Sesame oil
      1 pk Egg roll skins or wrappers
           Oil for frying
      1    Egg, beaten
 
  Mix filling ingredients together. Put mixture in the freezer awhile to
  cool. Warm meat tends to soften the wrappers and make things messy.
  Heat vegetable oil in fryer to 325 degrees.
  To roll, place about 3 tb filling mixture in the center of the wrapper.
  Fold 1 corner over mixture and fold in ends. Continue rolling. Brush egg
  mixture on exposed corner of wrapper to help seal egg roll.
  Put egg rolls in hot oil, a few at a time, and fry a few minutes on each
  side until golden brown. Remove to drain on paper towels. Serve warm with
  soy sauce, hot mustard, or sauce of your choice. Makes 18 egg rolls.

      1 tb Dry sherry
           Carrots, finely chopped
           (for garnish)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 c  (about 1/2 lb) ground pork,
           Uncooked
      2 md Fresh mushrooms,
           Chopped fine
      2    Scallions, chopped fine
           (white parts separate from

    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Peanut oil

      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Plum sauce
           Dash hot chili oil or
           Tabasco
           Sauce
 
  In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl, combine all
  the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of the chopped
  scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to blend well. In a
  8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a quarter of the egg
  mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet.  Heat until the egg pancake has
  barely set, then transfer to a plate.  Make 3 more pancakes. Divide the
  filling into 4 portions and put a portions on each pancake. Moisten your
  fingers with cold water and spread the filling mixture evenly over the
  surface of the pancake, then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll.
  Seal with a little leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls
  on a flat plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an
  inch of simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
  ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the slant.
  Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens and the
  carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Chinese
      Yield: 30 servings
 
      1    Wrapper recipe
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Oil
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Chopped shrimp
    1/4 c  Ground pork
      1 c  Minced water chestnuts
    1/4 c  Minced scallions
    1/4 c  Minced onions
      1    Egg
      1 ts Pepper
      1 ts Salt
 
  Boil wrapper. Remove from heat and pour in 1 1/2 cup flour and beat until
  it forms a ball.  Divide into 1 1/4 inch balls and roll each until paper
  thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and seal. Arrange in
  steamer and steam 30 minutes.
  
       Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker wrappers
  (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1 inch thick) and
  the filling can be just about anything.  I have done these with leftover
  meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms, celery etc.

      Title: FUN GWAU (STEAMED TRANSLUCENT DUMPLINGS)
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork, Chinese
      Yield: 30 servings
 
      6    Dried Chinese black
           Mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled & deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           Chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           Sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           Coriander leaves
      1    Oil
           Wheat Starch Wrappers
           (see recipe)
           Light soy sauce, for
           Dipping
           Chinese mustard, for
           Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a
  unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors.  Roll out the
  wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms.  Cut off
  the stems at the base and discard them.  Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes.  Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly.  Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce.  Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok.  Stir fry for 1 minute longer.  Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander.  Allow the
  filling to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.
  An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press
  or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of
  the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling
  inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate).  Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes.  Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Title: PASTA WITH PORK & BASIL
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Pasta, Pork
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta
      6 oz Mushrooms
           Fresh basil, parsley, chives

-----------------------------FOR THE MEATBALLS-----------------------------
      1 lb Lean freshly minced pork
           Parmesan cheese
           Fresh basil
           Garlic
    1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
           A little butter or oil

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
    1/2 oz Butter
  1 1/2 tb Plain flour
    1/4 pt Double cream
    1/2 pt (scant) stock
           Parmesan cheese
           Dijon mustard
 
  Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
  tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
  clove, as well as salt and pepper.  Flour your hands and shape the mixture
  into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan for 5 minutes
  or more until golden and cooked right through.  Shake the pan frequently so
  the meatballs keep in good shape and cook evenly.  Transfer to a casserole
  and keep hot.
  
      Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
  meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock.  Make a
  smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream.  Add any juices
  that have collected in the casserole and simmer for several minutes. Away
  from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1
  heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard.  Pour the sauce over the meatballs, cover
  and keep hot in a low oven.  The mixture can be kept hot for some time
  without spoiling, or it can be prepared ahead and reheated close to
  serving.
  
      Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the casserole
  together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2 tablespoons each
  basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss gently to mix well. Garnish
  with more basil, and serve with an undressed salad.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 ts Oil
      1 lb Ground pork
      4    -to
      8    Garlic cloves
           -- finely chopped
      3    Green onions, white part
           -- chopped
    3/4 c  Roasted salted peanuts
      1    Fresh pineapple; -OR-
      5    -Tangerines, -OR-
      4    -Oranges
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Pepper
           Lettuce leaves
           Mint or coriander leaves
           Chopped chilis
 
  Grind peanuts.  Heat oil in a frying pan, add pork, garlic and onions. Cook
  until pink color disappears.  Drain off most of the fat.  Add sugar and
  pepper, cook 1-2 minutes.  Add peanuts, mix in well, then remove from heat.
  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves.  Peel and segment the citrus
  fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and fanning open to
  form a circle.  If using pineapple, cut off top leaves and outer skin, as
  thinly as possible, from top down.  Look at the "eye" pattern, as it forms
  a spiral down the pineapple.  Cut the spirals with a sharp knife held at
  about a 45 degree angle.  Cut off bottom.  Cut pineapple into about 5 or 6
  wedges and then cut each of those into 1/4 inch slices. Arrange fruit on
  platter.
  
  Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes.  Serve at
  room temperature, or chilled.

 Categories: Mexican, Pork
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 ts Chilled margarine
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Ice water
      2 oz Cooked ground pork, crumbled
           -(OR finely chopped
           Cooked ham)
      2 oz Monterey Jack or Cheddar
           -cheese, shredded
      1 ts Prepared spicy brown mustard
      1 ds Crushed red pepper
      1    Egg separated
      1 tb Skim milk
 
  Paprika Garnish: red bell pepper strips and cilantro leaves
  
  In small bowl, with pastry blender or 2 knives, cut margarine into flour
  until mixture resembles corn meal; sprinkle with ice water and, using fork,
  mix to form soft dough.  Roll dough between 2 sheets of wax paper to form
  rectangle about 1/4 inch thick; remove paper and use 2-inch diameter plain
  or fluted cookie cutter to cut dough into rounds.  Roll scraps of dough and
  continue cutting until all dough has been used (should yield 24 rounds).
  Combine pork (or ham), cheese, mustard, and red pepper in small bowl and
  set aside.  Preheat oven to 375.
  
  Beat egg white lightly and brush an equal amount onto each pastry round.
  Spoon an equal amount of the meat mixture (about 1/2 rounded teaspoon) onto
  center of each round; fold pastry over, turnover-fashion, to enclose
  filling.  Press edges of dough together to seal.  Transfer turnovers to
  nonstick cookie sheet.  Add milk to egg yolk and beat lightly; brush an
  equal amount of mixture over each turnover and sprinkle each with a dash of
  paprika.  Bake until turnovers are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer
  to warmed serving tray; garnish with red pepper strips and cilantro. Chili
  sauce or salsa can be served as a dipping sauce.
  
  Makes 8 servings of 3 turnovers each.

      1 ts Paprika
      1 ts Mustard, Prepared
      2 tb Parsley, Chopped
      3    Hard Cooked Eggs, Peeled
      4    Bacon, Strips
      4 tb Vegetable Oil
      1 c  Beef Broth

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/4 c  Water, Hot
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
 
  Thoroughly mix ground meats, onion, bread crumbs, 3 T cold water, and eggs.
  Flavor with salt, praprika, mustard, and parsley.  Blend ingredients
  thoroughly.  Flatten out meat mixture in the shape of a square, (8 X
  8-inches).  Arrange whole hard-boiled eggs in a row along the middle of the
  meat.  Fold sides of meat pattie over the eggs. Shape meat carefully into a
  loaf resembling a flat bread loaf. Occasionally rinse hands in cold water
  to prevent sticking.  Cube 2 strips bacon; cook in a Dutch oven about 2
  minutes.  Carefully add the vegetable oil; heat. Place meatloaf in the
  Dutch oven and cook until browned on all sides. Cut remaining bacon strips
  in half and arrange over the top of the meatloaf. Place uncovered Dutch
  oven in a preheated oven for about 45 minutes. While meat is baking,
  gradually pour hot beef broth over the top of the meatloaf; brush
  occasionally with pan drippings. When done remove meat to a preheated
  platter and keep it warm. Add 1/4 cup of hot water to pan and scrape all
  particles from the bottom.  Bring to a gentle boil and add cornstarch that
  has been mixed with 1/4 cup water.  Cook until bubbly and thick. Remove
  from heat and stir in sour cream.  Reheat to warm.  Season with salt and
  pepper if desired.  Serve the sauce separately.

      Title: GNOCCHI ALLO SAFFERANO
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Semolina flour
    1/4 c  Olive oil, extra virgin
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Parsley, chopped
    1/2 ts Saffron
      3 oz Pork fat, chopped
      7 oz Ground pork
      7 oz Lamb, lean, ground
  1 1/2 lb Tomatoes, chopped fine in
           -food processor
      2    Bay leaves
      6    Sage leaves, fresh or
           -1/2 tsp dried
           Salt and pepper
    3/4 c  Aged pecorino cheese
           -optional
 
  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:  1:30 To make
  gnocchi, pour flour onto work surface and make a well in the centre. Pour
  in the olive oil.  Dissolve saffron in a bit of warm water and add to well.
  Mix liquid with flour, adding enough water to form a firm, not sticky,
  dough.  You'll have to add the water 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough is
  the right consistency.  Cut dough into pieces and roll into long cylinders,
  about 1/2 inch diameter.  Cut into 1-inch chunks and press your finger into
  each gnocchi to make a deep dent. Set gnocchi aside on a floured surface to
  dry while you make the sauce. Heat pork fat in saute pan and cook the onion
  and parsley until tender. Stir in the ground meat and cook until no longer
  pink.  Add the chopped tomatoes, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Cook,
  uncovered, for an hour or until the sauce is thickened. Cook gnocchi in
  boiling salted water until cooked al dente.  Drain and arrange in pasta
  dishes.  Pour sauce over top and garnish with a handful of grated cheese.

      Title: HACKBRATEN (FALSCHER HAS)
 Categories: Beef, Pork, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    250 g  Ground pork (a generous 1/2
           -lb)
    250 g  Ground beef (a generous 1/2
           -lb)
    100 g  Plain breadcrumbs (3.5 oz)
      2    Eggs
      1    Onion, finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, mashed or
           -minced
      1 bn Parsley, finely chopped
      1 pn Sugar
      2 tb Lard
      1    Onion, sliced
      4    To 5 cloves garlic, whole
    1/2    Yellow turnip, sliced
           -[substitute: carrot]
           Water for pan gravy
 
  Mix the ground meat with all the other ingredients [except for the lard,
  the sliced yellow turnip, sliced onion, and whole garlic cloves] and shape
  into a rectangular loaf.  Put in a casserole dish with the lard, the sliced
  onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced yellow turnip.  Roast at 390 degrees
  F until the onions turn brown.  Then, add a little bit of water. Continue
  to roast, basting frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is
  getting too dark, cover the top of the meatloaf with aluminum foil.  In the
  olden days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the
  same effect.
  
  At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may be
  served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan juices.
  
  Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: KOETTBULLAR (SWEDISH MEATBALLS)
 Categories: Appetizers, Hamburger, Swedish, Beef, Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Unseasoned bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Half and half cream
      4 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Minced white onions
    1/3 lb Ground beef
    1/3 lb Ground veal
    1/3 lb Ground pork
      1 lg Egg
    1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  1.  Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5 minutes in a large
  mixing bowl.
  
  2.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over low to moderate
  heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the onions and saute them for
  about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly.
  
  3.  Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt, pepper, and onions to the
  bread-crumb mixture. Gently combine the ingredients with your hands.
  
  4.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a couple of hours.
  
  5.  Shape the meat mixture with your hands into uniform 2/3-inch balls.
  Arrange them on a plate in one layer so they do not touch each other. Let
  the meatballs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  
  6.  Melt the remaining butter in a saute pan or skillet over moderate heat.
  When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs. (Do not crowd the pan;
  unless your pan is oversized, you will have to cook gthe meatballs in
  batches and keep the cooked ones warm in a preheated 200 degree F oven.)
  Saute the meatballs for about 5 minutes until they become brown on all
  sides. Turn them as necessary, but do so gently.

      Yield: 30 servings
 
      6    Dried Chinese black
           Mushrooms
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled & deveined
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      6 oz Ground pork butt
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots
    1/4 c  Finely diced water
           Chestnuts, preferably fresh
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry
           Sherry
  1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Chicken stock
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           Coriander leaves
      1    Oil
           Wheat Starch Wrappers
           (see recipe)
           Light soy sauce, for
           Dipping
           Chinese mustard, for
           Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a
  unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll out the
  wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off
  the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling
  to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.
  An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press
  or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of
  the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling
  inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Frying chicken
      3    Dried lotus leaves
      4 lb Wet modeling clay

----------------------------------STUFFING----------------------------------
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      2 tb Salted mustard green,
           Minced
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Fresh ginger root, minced

------------------------------MIXTURE FOR SKIN------------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Medium sherry
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
 
  Prepare Chicken:  Trim excess fat from chicken; remove wing tips. Mix
  mixture for skin; rub chicken inside & out with it. Leave uncovered at room
  temperature, while coating is absorbed and dried. Repeat if necessary.
  
  Stuffing:  In hot wok, heat peanut oil to smoking. Stir-fry ground pork 2
  minutes; add mustard green, ginger & sugar; stir-fry 1 more minute. Remove
  & cool.
  
  Lotus Leaves:  Number of leaves depends on their size & that of chicken.
  Reduce heat under boiling water to simmer, & steep leaves for 3-5 minutes,
  until wet through & pliable (no longer or leaves may shred). Now soak in
  cold water for 10 minutes, or longer, until time to use them; open folded
  leaves in cold water to wash them.
  
  Wrap Chicken:  Preheat oven to 550 degrees.  Stuff chicken with pork
  mixture. Cut hard center out of lotus leaves, then slit along fold about 3"
  on each side of center, so cut away center can be overlapped. Wrap chicken
  in 3 layers of lotus leaves.  Tie securely with piece of cotton or fiber
  string (don't use nylon; it might melt). Spread soft, wet modeling clay
  about 1/2" thick on sheet of newspaper.  Bring clay pack around chicken &
  seal.  Remove newspaper. (Use foil if clay unavailable.)
  
  Roasting:  Place clay-covered chicken on rack in shallow roasting pan in
  preheated oven.  Bake for 1 hour; reduce heat to 350 degrees & bake for
  another 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Serve:  Present fired clay chicken to table.  Crack clay with suitable
  object, allowing some of steam to escape before you proceed. Remove clay;
  carefully cut open lotus leaves with scissors. Chicken will be very soft &
  tender; break apart to get at stuffing.  Serve guests, or invite them to
  pick with chopsticks.

      1 sm Egg

---------------------------------SEASONING---------------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar

  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling skin. Then
  bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much as possible,
  without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need, with
  the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming 10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.
  
  *  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are round
  and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by merely cutting
  off the corners to round off the skin.

      2 tb Fish sauce
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2    Limes, juice only
      3 tb Vinegar
    1/4 c  Brown sugar or half brown
           -and half palm sugar
           Oil, for deep-frying
      6 oz Rice sticks
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 md Onion, finely diced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 sm Red or green chile, seeds

    3/4 lb Minced pork, diced chicken,

           -mixture
      2    Green onions, sliced, for
           -garnish
 
  This special occasion noodle dish is a favorite in many Thai restaurants.
  Some versions are extremely sweet and sticky; this version is less so, but
  the important flavors are still sweet, sour, and salty in that order. Be
  sure to use a large enough pan for saucing the noodles (step 5); a 14-inch
  wok is ideal.
  
  1. In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, and
  sugar and set aside.
  
  2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Drop approximately
  an ounce of rice sticks into the oil; they will puff up and rise to the top
  of the oil in only a few seconds. Turn them over once and fry until crisp,
  about 15 seconds in all. Transfer finished noodles to a pan lined with
  paper towels and continue frying the batter in small batches. Keep noodles
  warm in a low oven.
  
  3. Dip a hand in the beaten egg and, holding your hand approximately 8
  inches above the hot oil, drizzle egg over the surface in a random pattern.
  Continue with about half the egg mixture, forming a lacy network of egg.
  Fry until golden brown on underside, turn over once, and brown other side.
  Transfer to a plate and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining egg.
  
  4. Heat a second wok over medium high heat and add approximately 2
  tablespoons oil from the first wok. Add onion, garlic, and chile and cook
  until they are fragrant. Add meats or shrimp and stir-fry just until done.
  
  5. Stir sugar mixture and add to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until
  slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low and add about a quarter of the fried
  noodles and eggs. Stir together and toss to break up noodle clumps and coat
  with sauce. Continue adding noodles and eggs in batches until all are
  coated with sauce. Transfer to serving platter and garnish with sliced
  green onion.
  
  Serves 4 with other dishes.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 lb Ground venison
      6 lb Ground pork (lean)
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Pepper
    1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
    1/2 t  Sage
    1/2 c  Honey
 
  When the venison, pork and hot water are well mixed, add spices and honey
  to mixture and mix in well.
  
  This is probably my favorite recipe eventhough this is the one which has
  evolved the most in the past 5 years.  A couple of years ago my father
  mistakenly calculated the spices in tablespoons instead of teaspoons, and
  it
  was better then the previous batch of sausage written above.  The next
  year we
  increased the amount of black pepper, and was it ever good.  So if you like
  spices, and in sausage a little spice is good, then play around with the
  mixture a little bit.  I will be adding a small amount of a "cajun" pepper
  mix
  to a small 20 lb. test batch of sausage this weekend.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-------------------------------ACCOMPANIMENTS-------------------------------
           Nuoc Cham
      1 bn Of mint
      1 bn Of coriander

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 oz Cellophane (bean thread)
           -noodles
      4 oz Lean ground beef
      4 oz Ground pork shoulder
      4 oz Fresh or canned crabmeat,

      2 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Egg

---------------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     24    Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang) each 8 1/2 inches
           -in diameter.
     24    Raw medium shrimp, peeled
           -with tail section
           -attached, deveined
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, along comes a
  recipe for Fried Shrimp Rolls!!!  These triangular little goodies are
  great when served alongside Cha Gio.  These are *really* good!
  Prepare the Nuoc Cham. Wash and dry the mint and coriander leaves.
  
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the noodles in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Drain. Cut into 1-inch lengths.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  Rice paper is quite fragile.  Work with
  only 2 sheets at a time, keeping the remaining sheets covered with a
  barely damp cloth to prevent curling.
  
  Immerse 1 sheet of rice paper into the warm water.  Remove and spread
  flat on a dry towel.  Soak a second sheet of rice paper and spread it
  out without touching the other round.  The rice papers will become
  pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Place 1/2 tablespoon of the
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Place 1 shrimp in
  the filling, leaving the tail section extended over the fold line.
  Top the shrimp with an additional 1/2 tablespoon of filling and press
  into a compact triangle, forming a point where the tail extends (it
  is important that the filling be flat so it can be wrapped entirely
  and tightly). Fold the sides over to enclose the filling, then fold
  the remaining sides over to seal the compact triangle.  The completed
  roll resembles a triangle with a handle.  Fill the remaining wrappers
  in the same manner.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
  Add a few rolls to each skillet; don't let them touch or they will
  stick together. Cook over moderate heat for 10 to 12 minutes, turning
  often until crisp and golden brown.  Drain the rolls on paper towels.
  Keep warm in a low oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Serve the shrimp rolls as an appetizer with the Nuoc Cham, mint and
  coriander leaves.
  
  NOTE:  These rolls may be cooked in advance then reheated in a 350F
  oven for about 20 minutes, or until crisp.
  
  Yield: 24 shrimp rolls.

      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Eggs

---------------------------ASSEMBLING AND FRYING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
     80 sm Rounds of rice paper (banh
           -trang), each 6 1/2 inches
           -in diameter
           Peanut oil, for frying
 
  This is another version of the superlative Cha Gio (also called
  Nems). The filling here is a bit more elaborate than in the first
  one. Boil the noodles.  Prepare the Nuoc Cham and Vegetable Platter.
  Set aside.
  
  Prepare the filling:  Soak the two types of mushrooms in hot water
  until soft, about 30 minutes.  Drain.  Remove the stems from the
  mushrooms and squeeze to extract the liquid.  Mince the mushrooms.
  Combine the mushrooms with the remaining filling ingredients in a
  large bowl. Mix with your hands to blend.  Set aside.
  
  Assemble the rolls:  Fill a mixing bowl with 4 cups of warm water and
  dissolve the sugar in it.  The rice paper sheets are brittle and must
  be handled with care.  (The water is used to soften the sheets for
  handling. Sweetening the water helps the rice paper turn a deep
  golden color when fried and also produces crisper rolls.) Work with
  only 4 sheets of rice paper at a time, keeping the remaining sheets
  covered with a barely damp cloth to prevent curling. One at a time,
  immerse a sheet in the warm water. Quickly remove it and spread flat
  on a dry towel. Do not let the sheets touch each other.  The rice
  paper will become pliable within seconds.
  
  Fold up the bottom third of each round.  Put 1 generous teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the folded-over portion.  Press into a
  compact rectangle. Fold one side of the paper over the mixture, then
  the other side. Roll from bottom to top to completely enclose the
  filling. Continue until all of the mixture is used.
  
  Fry the rolls:  If possible, fry in 2 skillets.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2
  inches of oil into each skillet and heat to 325F.  Working in
  batches, add some of the rolls to each skillet, but do not crowd or
  let them touch, or they will stick together.  Fry over moderate heat
  for 10 to 12 minutes, turning often, until golden and crisp.  Remove
  the rolls with tongs and drain on paper towels.  Keep warm in a low
  oven while frying the remaining rolls.
  
  Traditionally, Cha Gio is served with the accompaniments suggested in
  this recipe.
  
  To eat, each diner wraps a roll in a lettuce leaf along with a few
  strands of noodles and a variety of other ingredients from the
  Vegetable Platter before dipping it in the Nuoc Cham.  If served as
  an hors d'ouvre, allow 4 or 5 rolls per person; serve 8 to 10 as a
  main course.
  
  NOTE:  Another popular way of serving this dish is to divide the
  noodles and elements of the Vegetable Platter evenly among the
  individual bowls. Top each with cut-up pieces of Cha Gio, ground
  roasted peanuts and Nuoc Cham.
  
  As a quick and easy appetizer, Cha Gio can be served with just Nuoc
  Cham.
  
  Yield: about 80 spring rolls.

      Title: FRIED WON TONS
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Won ton skins
    1/2 lb Fresh ground pork
    1/2 lb Fresh prawns
      4    Dried mushrooms, soaked for
           -2 hours
      8    Water chestnuts, finely
           -chopped
      2    Stalks green onions, finely
           -chopped
      2 sm Eggs, beaten
    1/4 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Here are three won ton related recipes++fried won tons, won ton soup
  and a dip for the fried won tons.  I have recipes for won ton dough
  too, if you want them.  Personally, I find the won ton skins
  available in markets to be just fine and a lot less work!
  
  Yield: About 60 to 70.
  
  Shell and devein prawns.  Mince fine.  Stem mushrooms and mince caps.
  Mix with prawns, pork, water chestnuts, green onions, half of the
  beaten eggs and all of the seasonings.
  
  WRAPPING:
  
  Place won ton squares on working surface so corners face up, down,
  left and right.  Place 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each skin.
  
  Dip a little of the beaten egg onto the bottom corner, bring top
  corner to meet bottom corner.  Press to seal.  Moisten left corner
  and bring right corner to meet it.  Press to seal.  [This should give
  you a little bundle that looks kinda like a nurses hat.  S.C.]
  
  FRYING:
  
  Heat 4 cups oil in wok.  Fry wrapped won ton until golden (about 2
  minutes).  Turn over once.  Drain and serve hot.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES:
  
  Deep fry won ton, cool and freeze.  To reheat, preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Place frozen won ton onto cookie sheets and heat for 12 to 15 minutes.
  
  COMMENTS:
  
  You may substitute ground turkey for meat in won ton filling.
  
  However since turkey is drier and more bland than pork, add a few more
  water chestnuts and 1/4 tsp. monosodium glutamate to enhance flavor
  and texture.

      Title: NUOC LEO (PEANUT SAUCE)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Clove garlic, sliced
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Piece of pork liver (see
           -note below), minced
      1 tb Ground pork
      1 ts Tomato paste
    1/4 c  Tuong
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 ts Peanut butter
      1 tb Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 tb Sesame seeds
     10    Roasted peanuts, coarsely
           -chopped [I use unsalted
           -Planter's roasted
           Peanuts.]
           Thin strips of hot pepper
           -for garnish
 
  I prefer the following version.  It's a bit more complex, but one of
  the ingredients might be a bit hard to find++tuong, a kind of soy
  bean paste used in Vietnam.  A good Vietnamese market will have it.
  Using medium heat, fry the garlic in the oil.  Add the liver and
  pork. Lower the heat and add the tomato paste; stir and add the
  tuong. Stir again and add the water and peanut butter.  Raise the
  heat to medium and add the sugar. Boil for 1 minute and transfer to a
  bowl.
  
  Add the sesame seeds to a medium-hot frying pan, stirring constantly
  until browned.  This should take 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the sesame
  seeds to the nuoc leo, along with the chopped peanuts.
  
  The sauce can be garnished with thin strips of hot pepper.
  
  NOTE:  Beef or chicken liver can be substituted, but pork liver is
  preferred.  The piece should be the size of a large chicken liver.

 Categories: Poultry, Stuffing, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 tb Butter or margarine
    500 g  Minced pork
      2 c  Sultanas
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
     10    Green (spring) onions,
           -chopped
      2    Onions, finely chopped
      1 c  Bread crumbs

  The next four posts should come in handy on the next holiday when
  you're faced with yet another turkey to fix.  One is from the US, the
  rest are from other parts of the world.  The Argentine Creole
  Stuffing looks *very* interesting.  All these assume you know how to
  stuff and cook a turkey.
  
  Plump sweet sultanas marry well with turkey meat, the pork mince adds
  richness and moistness and the generous quantity of fresh herbs lifts
  this stuffing out of the ordinary.
  
  Melt butter and gently fry minced pork until it changes colour,
  pressing out lumps with a fork.  Add to the rest of the ingredients
  and mix well.

      Title: SICHUAN DRY-FRIED STRING BEANS
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Dried shrimp
      1 tb Preserved Sichuan Preserved
           -Vegetable (jar choy)
      3 c  Peanut oil for deep frying
      1 lb String beans, snapped in
           -half
      1 tb Minced ginger
      1 tb Finely chopped garlic
      4 oz Ground pork butt
      1    Green onion, minced
      1 ts Sugar
        pn White pepper
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Chicken stock
           A swirl of sesame oil
 
  This green-bean dish is outstanding.  The green beans exude aromatic
  flavors and have an interesting chewy texture.  I do not fry the
  beans as long as traditional recipes call for because I want them to
  have some texture left.
  
  Cover the dried shrimp with hot water for 30 minutes.  Drain.  Chop
  into the consistency of coarse bread crumbs.
  
  Rinse the Sichuan preserved vegetables with cold water to wash off the
  brine and salt; chop into the same texture as the shrimp. In a hot
  wok add the oil and heat to 375F.
  
  Deep fry the beans in two or three batches for 2 to 3 minutes or
  until they look wrinkled, blistered and khaki color.
  
  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the oil from the wok.  Reheat the wok
  over high heat.
  
  Add the ginger and garlic; stir-fry for 15 seconds.  Add the pork,
  preserved mustard, dried shrimp; stir-fry for 1 minute longer. Poke
  and break up the clumps of pork so that it looks crumbled.  Add the
  green onion, sugar, white pepper and soy sauce; toss together to
  blend.
  
  Return the reserved green beans, chicken stock and sesame oil; toss
  vigorously over high heat until all liquids are reduced and absorbed,
  about 2 to 3 minutes.  Serve hot or at room temperature.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: TAPIOCA SOUP
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      5 c  Pork stock [Chicken works
           -just fine. S.C.]
    1/2 c  Minced or ground pork
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      3 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 c  Tapioca
    1/2 c  Cooked or canned crab meat
           Pepper

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
     12    Coriander leaves
 
  Tapioca is a plant product made from the roots of the cassava plant-
  ~also called manioc.  It's a major product in Thailand and I saw
  "tapioca trees" all over the place.  The plant itself isn't a tree,
  but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set
  upright in the fields so they don't rot during the rainy season.
  Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks
  like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be
  removed by cooking.  Those little balls are actually made++like
  risotto or "rice pasta".  It's usually used to make sweet puddings
  here, but in the Orient it's used to make thick, savory soups.  Like
  this one!
  
  Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot
  stock into a bowl and stir in the pork.  Return mixture to the pan.
  Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook
  for 5 to 10 minutes.  When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat
  and season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat.  Line
  individual soup bowls with the lettuce.  Pour in the soup and
  sprinkle with coriander leaves.
  
  From "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and Tettoni, Times
  Editions, Singapore.  1987.
  
  This is a simple, excellent soup and subject to all sorts of
  variations.

      Title: VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS (CHA GIO)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 oz Cellophane noodles,
           -soaked in warm water for
           -20 minutes, then drained
           -and cut onto 1-inch lengths
      1 lb Ground pork
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Tree ears, soaked in warm
           -water for 30 minutes, then
           -drained and finely chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, finely
           -chopped
      3    Shallots or white part of 3
           -scallions, finely chopped
      1 cn (7 ounces) crabmeat,
           -cartilage removed and meat
           -flaked with fingers
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper

------------------------PREPARATIONS FOR ASSEMBLING------------------------
     20    Sheets dried rice papers
           -(banh trang)
      4    Eggs, well beaten
      2 c  Peanut oil

-------------------------ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR SERVING-------------------------
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           Carrot Salad
           Double recipe of Nuoc Cham
 
  Here they are!  The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.
  
  Yields 80 spring rolls.
  
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper
  on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over
  the entire surface of each of the pieces.  Before filling, wait for
  the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes
  about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on
  several wrappers at a time.
  
  When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of
  filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.  Fold the
  sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.
  
  After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
  put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,
  and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown.  (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
  
  To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:
  
  Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint
  leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the
  directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc
  cham.  Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce,
  2 or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices.  Each
  person then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the
  nuoc cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using
  chopsticks or a fork.
  
  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.
  
  Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables
  on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a
  cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips
  it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.
  
  NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps
  them crisper than frying in any other oil.

  Barron's, 1979.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      2 c  Warm water
    1/4 c  Sugar
           Sixteen 8-inch round dried
           -rice paper wrappers
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
           Lettuce leaves
           Fresh mint leaves
           Cilantro leaves

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      3 tb Small dried tree ear
           -mushrooms
      2 oz Bean thread noodles
      1 lb Ground pork butt
      4    Garlic cloves, finely minced
      4    Shallots, minced
      1 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 ts Pepper
      1 c  Grated carrot
      1 c  Bean sprouts, tailed

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
      1    Garlic clove, squeezed
           -through a garlic press
    1/2 tb Sugar
      4 tb Fresh lime juice
      3 tb Fish sauce
      1    Fresh or dried red chile
           -seeded, finely minced
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Finely grated carrot
 
  Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial
  favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls.  I haven't tried this
  one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her
  stuff is usually bang-on.
  
  In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles
  in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes.  Rinse tree
  ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers.  Coarsely chop
  and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch
  lengths; set aside.
  
  Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper.  Add
  tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your
  hands.
  
  Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish
  sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10
  minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated
  carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.
  
  To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow
  pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a
  second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a
  wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens
  to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.
  
  Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact
  log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long.  Place the log
  along the bottom third of the wrapper.  Roll the bottom edge over the
  log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper
  is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to
  enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the
  wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.
  
  Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover
  with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.
  
  To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat
  fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time.  Do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds.  Immediately increase heat to high (375F).
  Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to
  8 minutes.
  
  Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.
  
  Serving suggestions:
  
  Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces .  Dip into sauce and
  enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of
  coriander and mint.  Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part
  of a multi course meal.
  
  NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray
  with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate
  them overnight, wrapped in plastic.  Don't keep them longer than 1
  day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and
  frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet
  and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.
  
  Makes 16 rolls.

      Title: VIETNAMESE PORK BURGERS
 Categories: Vietnamese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Lean ground pork
      3    Garlic cloves, chopped
      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Soy sauce
      2 ts Peanut or other mild
           -vegetable oil
        pn Sugar
           Few drops Tabasco sauce, or
           -pinch cayenne pepper
           Hoisin sauce
        lg Whole lettuce leaves
    1/2 c  Or so roasted peanuts,
           -coarsely ground
           Handful cilantro, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,
  the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form.  All
  these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.
  Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and
  texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,
  each of which balances these assertive flavors.
  
  Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and
  Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked
  through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped
  in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
  
  PER SERVING:  310 calories, 27 g protein, 5 g carbohydrate, 20 g fat
  (5 g saturated), 76 mg cholesterol, 263 mg sodium, 2 g fiber.
  
  NOTE: In the body of the accompanying article, the author suggests
  using pita bread lightly spread with hoisin and putting the patties
  into it along with some of the cabbage salad.  That's probably the
  way I'd go.

      Title: Jook, Chinese Thick Rice Soup
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Long Grain Rice
    1/2 c  Glutinous Rice
      5 qt Chicken Broth
      1 lb Ground Pork
      1 tb Dark Soy Sauce
      1 t  Salt
      2 ea Green Onion Stalks
     12 ea Water Chestnuts
 
  Rinse rice 2 or 3 times. Soak overnight. Mince green onions and water
  chestnuts. Mix with ground pork, soy sauce and salt.
  Bring stock and rice to a boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 2-3 hours or
  until the rice breaks down completely and the soup becomes thick and
  creamy. Turn heat up and add ground pork mixture, shaping 1 tsp at a time
  into a small ball and dropping it into the soup. Cook for 5 minutes or
  until pork balls are done. Correct seasoning. Serve in individual soup
  bowls. Pass the condiments around for each person to choose his or her
  favourite toppings. I like Nam-Yuey in mine!
  You can make this ahead of time and reheat.
  You can also use chicken slices, ground beef, beef slices, fish filets or
  ham slices. A roast chicken or turkey carcass is excellent for making the
  stock. Just cook the carcass, rice and water together. Take out the
  carcass when the soup is done. I add Duck Liver Sausage bits!
  Condiments which you can use:
  Sesame oil, White Pepper, Green Onions, Chinese Parsley (cilantro), tea
  melon (sweet cucumber), Szechwan turnips, chopped peanuts, Deep Fried
  Devils (Yao Ja Guai, which are small fried bread sticks), NAM-YUEY!

      Title: Blistered String Beans with Pork
 Categories: Vegetables, Chinese, Cathe
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      3 c  Oil
      2 lb String beans
    3/4 lb Ground pork
    1/2 T  Dried shrimp
      4 T  Dry sherry
      2 T  Szechuan mustard green
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Water
      1 T  Soy sauce
      1 T  Sesame oil
 
  Rinse the beans and break off the ends; dry them thoroughly to reduce
  spattering during deep-frying.  Rinse and mince the Szechuan mustard green.
  
  Wash the dried shrimp and soak them in sherry for 1 hour.  Drain them,
  reserving the sherry.  Mince the shrimp.
  
  Mix the sherry from the shrimp with the chicken broth, water, soy sauce and
  sesame oil.  Reserve.
  
  Heat the oil in a wok (or deep pan) until a bamboo chopstick sizzles when
  put into the oil.  Deep fry the beans in 5 or 6 batches, until they develop
  brown blisters and shrivel slightly. Remove them batch by batch; drain each
  batch and keep them warm while you remove all but 2 T oil from the pan.
  
  Heat the 2 T of oil until very hot and add the ground pork.  Stir fry until
  it is broken up into very small pieces and no longer is pink. Add the
  minced shrimp and Szechuan mustard green.  Stir for 30 seconds. Add the
  string beans and stir to mix well for about 15 seconds.
  
  Add the liquid ingredients, toss until the liquid is reduced to 2
  tablespoons.  Serve on a warmed platter.

      Title: ENCHILADAS SABROSAS
 Categories: Meats, Latin, Usenet
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Ground meat (mixed
           -ground beef and
           -ground pork)
      1 md Onion
    1/2    Green pepper
      5    Garlic cloves
      1    Cilantro bunch
    1/2 t  Red pepper
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Cumin (or more)
    1/2 c  Wine or sherry
    3/4 c  Black olives
  1 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
           -(1 small can)
     12    Corn tortillas
    1/2 lb Monterey jack cheese
    1/2 c  Sour cream (optional)
           Oil
 
  Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground meats.
  Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the chopped green
  pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for another minute or two
  (until green pepper is cooked bright green).  Drain well, then add (about)
  several tablespoons of the enchilada sauce and cook for a few minutes
  longer. Set aside.
  
  Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce (from
  the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry, cumin, salt,
  red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how compulsive you
  are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and spicy.
  
  Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the
  enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy (you'll
  be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.
  
  The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some of
  its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package, separate them
  from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the frying pan surface on
  each side, to moisten them slightly with the grease. That done, stack them
  in the frying pan and heat them until they are soft and pliable.
  
  The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed:  Take the
  tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven  dish, curved into a
  "U" shape, each right next to its neighbor.  (At this point, start heating
  your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan.  I usually wind up preparing 10
  tortillas in all.)
  
  Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed by an
  appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive halves.  Then
  curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the opposite end, and
  carefully rotate it to conceal the seam.  Each tortilla should be filled
  firmly (not too loosely) but not overflowing the ends.
  
  Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled
  tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the
  crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover with
  aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the tortillas are soft
  and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5 minutes, then serve, topped
  with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail to drain the meat well enough, the
  enchiladas will be greasy. If over-baked, it tastes all right, but the
  tortillas lose their texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite
  forgiving in its proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own
  tolerance for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours
  before baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for
  a day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and some
  Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Enchiladas with meat, black olives and cheese -- For many years, I've
  been involved in Latin American "solidarity work" here in the San Francisco
  area, and as a result, I have learned some of its culinary pleasures. This
  recipe originated from the back of a can of enchilada sauce in Mexico, but
  was refined by a special Chilean refugee friend who won a scholarship to
  the California Culinary Academy (in San Francisco) and now cooks
  ever-so-lusciously.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK, but time the baking carefully.
