  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways of
  preparing dry beans for cooking.  All start with a thorough inspection for
  damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in cold water.  The next
  step, which is highly recommended, is soaking the beans.  This not only
  helps make the beans cook faster, it also improves flavor, texture,
  appearance and digestibility.  For maximum improvement of these factors, it
  is recommended that the soak water be discarded and the beans rinsed and
  cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so be sure
  to start with a large enough pot.  (Note:  up to 2 teaspoons of salt per
  pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.)
  Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover and
  set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak method), but *preferably* four
  hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater
  amount of the gas-causing properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping
  the beans to be more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects.
  Whether you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to
  DISCARD THE SOAK WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt.  Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness is
  reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons onion salt
  and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Add 1 Tablespoon
  chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans when
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker helps,
  but follow manufacturer's directions.  [Personal note:  Tom says 1/2 hour
  in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to cooking them
  overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure cooker, as they
  expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or kidney
  beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings, lard, oil,
  butter or margarine.

      Title: Aigo Bouido (Garlic Soup)
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  6
 
      1    Separated head or about 16
           -cloves whole, unpeeled
           -garlic
      2 qt Water
      1 ts Salt
      1 pn Of pepper
      2    Cloves
    1/4 ts Sage
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/2    Bay leav
      4    Sprigs parsley
      3 tb Olive oil
 
  This isn't cream of garlic soup, but it has a creamy texture.  I've done
  this one and it's great.  As Julia says, "Because the garlic is boiled, its
  after-effects are at a minimum, and its flavor becomes exquisite, aromatic
  and almot undefinable."
  
  From Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. I":
  
  Drop garlic cloves in boiling water and boil for 30 seconds.  Drain, run
  cold water over them and peel.  Place the garlic and the rest of the
  ingredients in a 3-quart saucepan and boil slowly for 30 minutes. Correct
  seasoning.
  
  3 egg yolks 3 to 4 T. olive oil
  
  Beat the egg yolks with a wire whip in a soup tureen for a minute or until
  they are thick and sticky.  Drop by drop beat in the olive oil for making a
  mayonnaise.
  
  Rounds of hard-toasted French bread 1 cup of grated Swiss or Parmesan
  cheese
  
  Just before serving, beat a ladleful of hot soup into the egg mixture by
  droplets.  Gradually strain in the rest, beating and pressing the juice out
  of the garlic.  Serve immediately, accompanied by the bread and cheese.

      Title: Austrian Homestyle Generic Vegetable Soup
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  3
 
      4 tb Butter or margarine (or oil,
           -or lard)
      3 tb All purpose flour
  1 1/2 pt Water
  3 1/2 ts Knorr Beef Flavor Consomme
           -Mix (or similar bouillon
           Powder or cubes)
      2 tb Chopped onion
      1 md Carrot, diced
      2 c  (approx.) broccoli or
           -cauliflower, cut into small
           -pieces
      1 md Potato, peeled and diced
 
  Melt butter over medium heat.  Add flour, stirring constantly, until the
  mixture becomes puffy.  Add water, bouillon powder, onions, potatoes and
  carrots.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat and simmer
  until potatoes are almost done (about 5 to 6 minutes).  Add broccoli and
  return to boil.  Simmer for another minute.
  
  Makes 3 large servings (which with a chunk of French bread or the like
  would make a hearty meal, quantity-wise.)
  
  VARIATIONS:  For thinner soup, use less flour.  For vegetables with a more
  delicate flavor, use less bouillon powder.  If using sliced mushrooms,
  asparagus and frozen or fresh green peas as vegetables, use slightly less
  flour, slightly less bouillon powder, and a dash of sugar. (Start with the
  asparagus, adding peas and mushrooms when asparagus is almost done. No
  onion in that one, BTW, it would overwhelm the other flavors.) If all

      3    Stalks celery, chopped
      2 md Carrots, chopped
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1 c  Chopped turnip

    1/2 ts Thyme
      1 cn (19oz) kidney OR pinto
           -beans, drained and rinsed
 
  Prep time: 25 minutes.
  
  When the vegetables are finely chopped it takes only a short simmering time
  to develop and blend the flavors of the bacon and assorted winter
  vegetables. The beans add character and a heartiness that is satisfying.
  And an added plus - the soup is better a day or two after it is made. Store
  it in a covered container in the refrigerator.
  
  Cut bacon into thin slivers.  In a 12 cup saucepan, combine bacon,celery,
  carrots, onion, turnip, beef broth, bay leaf and thyme.  Bring to a boil;
  reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes or until vegetables are
  tender. Add beans and continue to simmer 5-10  minutes or until hot, and
  flavors are blended.  Remove the bay leaf and ladle into warm soup tureen
  or soup bowls. Makes 8 servings.

   Servings:  6
 
  2 1/2 c  Dried black beans, soaked
           -overnight
      1 lg Or 2 small ham hocks
      3    To 3.5 quarts water
      3 tb Olive oil
      2    To 3 large onions
      4    Cloves garlic
      3 sm Fresh green peppers
           -(jalapeanos if preferred)
      8    Berries allspice coarsely
           -crushed
      2 ts Brown sugar (or 1 t of
           -molasses)
      3 tb Tomato paste
    3/4 c  Creme fraiche or sour cream
 
  Salt Grated rind and juice from one lemon
  
  Put the drained beans and hock in a very large pan, cover with the cold
  water and bring gradually to a boil.  Leave to simmer while you prepare the
  other ingredients.
  
  In a frying pan heat the olive oil, then gently fry the onion, garlic and
  chili with the allspice and lemon rind, stirring occasionally, until the
  onions are translucent.  Add this mixture to the beans and go on simmering
  for 2 hours, by which time the beans should be tender.  At this point add
  the sugar, lemon juice, and tomato puree.  Cook for another 30 minutes. Add
  salt if necessary.
  
  Remove the hock, and pick off any meat.  If you would like a smooth soup,
  as mine (the author) was, process the mixture in batches and return with
  the meat to the pan.  Otherwise, for a rougher texture crush with a potato
  masher.  If the mixture seems too thick at this stage, add more water and
  bring back to the boil for a minute or two.
  
  Ladle the soup into bowls, with a spoonful or two of cream stirred in, and
  serve with a crusty bread.
  
  If you are feeling lavish, a couple of spoons of dark rum added towards the
  end give a Bajan fillip.
  
  INFO TEXT: Arriving stiff and crumpled inside and out after an eleven hour
  flight, this was my first taste of Bajan Cooking, and I ate it late at
  night trying to imagine the sea beyond a dark frieze of langourous palms.
  Dense but smooth, with a snap of chili, the soup was both homely and
  exotic, and very restoring.
  
  Barbados produces splendid ham and bacon, and a ham stock is what makes
  this different from other Carribean variants.  Or, as here, use a hock,
  soaked first to remove some salt.

  the puree into a large non-reactive bowl.
  
  Coarsely chop 1 of the cucumbers, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the green
  and red bell peppers.  Add the chopped vegetables to the processor (if
  using a blender, add 1/2 cup of the tomato or vegetable juice as well).
  Process until liquified; strain into the large bowl, pressing down with the
  back of a spoon to extract all liquid.
  
  Add to the bowl the remaining juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, vodka or
  vermouth if using, lime juice, worcestershire, Tabasco, cayenne pepper,
  celery salt and pepper.  Stir well.  Cover and refrigerate for 4 hours or
  overnight.
  
  Finely dice the Roma tomatoes, remaining 1/2 onion, 1/2 green and red
  peppers and 1 cucumber.  Add the finly diced celery.  Reserve, refrigerated
  in small mixing bowl.
  
  To serve, ladle soup into chilled individual bowls.  Sprinkle with the
  chopped vegetables and croutons, if using.
  
  Note:  If this is just for the family, I toss all of the diced vegetables
  right into the soup as it's chilling (it doesn't last long enough for the
  veggies to get limp).  And I might go to the trouble of making croutons, or
  maybe not.

    1/2 c  Raw white rice
      1 ts Worchestershire Sauce
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
           Ground pepper to taste
 
  NOTE:  This has a long cooking time.  It is a dish that is best prepared
  early in the day and reheated at serving time since the flavor improves.
  NOTE:  Ms. Brody says that this dish could easily feed a crowd if you have
  a pot or pots big enough to double or guadruple, etc. it.
  
  1.  In a large heavy pot combine all the soup ingredients except the
  raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat while preparing the
  meatballs.
  
  2.  Combine meatball ingredients, stirring them to mix thoroughly. With wet
  hands, roll the meat mixture in 1 1/4" balls.  Add the meatballs to the
  boiling cabbage soup, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 2
  hours.
  
  3.  Remove the cover, add the raisins, and cook for another 30 minutes in
  the uncovered pot.
  
  She suggests that mashed potatoes would be an excellent accompaniment.
  Also, that the dish goes well with broad egg noodles.

  Wash soup bones.  Put on aluminum lined tray and brown in a 400F oven until
  well browned on both sides.  Put bones in soup pot, drain grease and then
  get as much of the browned bits as possible using a little water to help
  them along.  Add water until the bones are well covered. Turn on heat. Add
  carrots, onions, celery, tomatoes (whatever goes with the soup) some salt
  and pepper and let simmer most of the day. Remove bones and chop what meat
  there is.  Throw out the vegetables and skim off as much fat as possible
  (if left in refrigerator overnight it will come to the top and get hard and
  can be removed easily).  Put chopped meat back, add 3 quarts whole tomatoes
  (mashed), a couple of cubed potatoes, and about a half package of frozen
  mixed vegetables.  Let simmer until potatoes are done and until needed. The
  soup is better the next day. Cooked noodles can be added.

  " Our black bean soup is a Silver Palate staple.  In this recipe we've
  dressed it up with lots of hot and garlicky sausages, sweet red peppers, a
  bit of brown sugar, and unusual spices.  This makes a meal when served with
  a crisp, tart green salad."
  
  Sour cream
  
  1.  Soak the black beans in water to cover overnight.
  
  2.  Heat 1 cup of the oil in a large heavy stock pot over low heat. Add the
  onions and garlic and saute until the onions are limp, about 10 minutes.
  
  3.  Drain and rinse the beans and add to the stock pot.  Add the ham bone
  and 6 quarts of the water.  Stir in the cumin, oregano, bay leaves, salt,
  pepper, cayenne, and 3 tablespoons of the parsely.  Heat to boiling. Reduce
  heat to medium and cook uncovered at a slow rolling boil for 2 hours,
  skimming foam from the top and stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
  
  4.  Place the garlic sausage in a medium-size saucepan and add the
  remaining 2 quarts water.  Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low and simmer
  for 40 minutes.  Drain.  Remove casings and cut into 1/2-inch slices.
  
  5.  Heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large heavy skillet over medium
  heat.  Add the Italian sausages and saute until browned.  Remove the
  sausages with a slotted spoon.
  
  6.  In the same skillet, saute the bratwurst until browned.  Remove with a
  slotted spoon.
  
  7.  After 2 hours of cooking, process 2 cups of the beans in a food
  processor fitted with a steel blade until smooth and return to the pot.
  Continue to cook for 30 minutes.
  
  8.  Add all the sausages and the red peppers and cook for another 30
  minutes.
  
  9.  Remove the ham bone from the soup, shred the meat and return to the
  pot.  Stir in the sherry, sugar, and lemon juice.
  
  10.  Cook over medium heat until the beans are very soft and the soup is
  thick, 30 to 45 minutes.  Stir in the remaining 5 tablespoons chopped
  parsley.  Taste and adjust seasonings.
  
  11.  Ladle the soup into soup bowls and dollop each serving with sour
  cream.
  
  Makes 16 portions.

      Title: Black Bean Soup with Cumin
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  4
 
      1 c  Black beans, soaked (see
           -methods below)
      7 c  Broth (chicken, beef, or
           -vegetable)
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 lg Onion, minced (1 cup)
      1 lg Clove garlic, minced (1
           -teaspoon)
    1/4 c  Diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced carrots
    3/4 ts Crushed cumin seed, or to
           -taste
    1/4 ts Freshly groun black pepper
    1/4 ts Salt, if desired
      1    Chopped hard-boiled egg or
           -egg white and chopped
           -scallions for garnish
 
  Here is another one from Jane Brody's Good Food Book
  
  The cumin gives this black bean soup a distinctive and, my tasters said,
  appealing flavor.  Preparation tip:  For peak flavor, I use whole toasted
  cumin seed crushed in a mortar with a pestle.  You may also use ground
  cumin.  This soup freezes well (before the garnish is added).  ... This
  soup could also be used as the main dish of a light meal, perhaps topped
  with a generous dollop of plain low-fat yogurt.
  
  1.  To soak the beans, place the washed beans in a bowl, cover them with
  cold water, and let them soak overnight or for at least 8 hours. _Or_ place
  the washed beans in a saucepan, add 4 cups water, bring the beans to a
  boil, boil them for 2 minutes, turn off the heat, and let the beans stand
  for 1 hour.
  
  2.  Drain the soaked beans, add the broth, bring the beans to a boil,
  reduce the heat to low, and simmer the beans, partially covering the pan,
  for 2 to 3 hours or until the beans are thoroughly cooked.
  
  3.  In a heavy skillet, heat the oil, add the onion and garlic, and cook
  them, stirring, over a low heat, until they are transparent.  Add the
  celery and carrots and cook the mixture, stirring, for a few minutes
  longer.  Add the vegetables to the beans.
  
  4.  Season soup with cumin, pepper, and salt, if desired, and simmer the
  soup for another 30 minutes.
  
  5.  Puree the soup in a blender, food processor, or food mill. Serve the
  soup hot, garnished with chopped egg and minced scallions.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  seasoning it contains salt; so don't add extra salt!!!!  Otherwise, add
  salt to taste.  When stew meat and peas come to a boil, reduce to Medium
  and keep watching to add water so they don't scorch.  After about 40
  minutes add packet of Rice and Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor.  Start
  watching the water really carefully now, and add a pint from time to time.
  After about 20 minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more
  seasonings if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery)  Everything
  should be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat!

      Title: Boston Clam Chowder
 Categories: Soups, Clams
   Servings:  6
 
      3    Cups+ of half-and-half and
           -heated the chowder to just
           -below the boiling
 
  I visited with the creator of this wonderful chowder and though he did not
  give me the recipe, he did share some hints.  He uses only cream and
  butter, no wimpy milk for him.  He starts with a roux with chopped celery
  and onion and adds thyme, bay leaf and white pepper for seasoning. If fresh
  clams are not available, he recommends Snow's Chopped Clams.
  
  Using his tips, what I know about clam chowder and a little research, I
  created a very good clam chowder the other night.  I don't have the
  ingredient amounts, but it doesn't really matter if you've had some kitchen
  experience.  The real secret came from Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana
  Kitchen cookbook.  I figured if I was going to mess with a roux, I might as
  well start with the expert roux maker.
  
  I made a 50/50 oil/flour roux --- using 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup
  butter and 1/2 cup flour.  I heated the oil as high as I dared and put in
  about 1/3 of the flour allowing it to foam and let the moisture in the
  flour escape --- be careful!  Roux can burn like hellfire.  I continued to
  add the flour and cooked the roux to a light golden color. I removed the
  roux from the heat and added about 1/2 cup finely chopped onions and 1/2
  cup finely chopped celery.  The hot roux cooks the veggies and the veggies
  cool down the roux.
  
  I drained the liquid from 4 7-ounce cans of clams and added a 7- ounce
  bottle of clam juice.  I put the clam nectar in a sauce pan and added about
  1 1/2 lbs of raw potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2" cubes.  I added some
  thyme and a couple of bay leaves and some freshly ground white pepper.
  
  When the potatoes were cooked, I added some of the roux to thicken the
  chowder.  I ended up using all the roux.  I added the clams and about
  point, stirring frequently and tasted it for seasoning adjustment. Toward
  the end, I threw in a handful of real bacon bits for an added smokey
  flavor.  I topped the pot with 1/2 cube of butter and let it sit for about
  an hour to allow the flavors to blend.
  
  The result was the best clam chowder I have ever made.  To complete the
  dinner I served sweet cornbread and a carrot and raisin salad.
  
  Sorry, the amounts are not precise, but if you plan ahead, it's difficult
  to go wrong.

      Title: Brenda's Black Bean Soup
 Categories: Soups, Beans
   Servings:  6
 
      3 c  Dried black beans
      2    Ham hocks
      1    Bell pepper (chopped)
      1 sm Onion (chopped)
      1    Whole sour orange or
           -tangerine
      1 tb Vinegar (if you used a sweet
           -orange or tangerine)
      1    Stick oleo
      2 tb Of flour
 
  Tried out the "White Trash Cookbook" last night and whipped up this black
  bean soup. In spite of the fact that I forgot to finish it with the browned
  flour and butter, it turned out pretty darn good, if a tad bland. (I did
  cheat and use real butter instead of oleo.) Here's the recipe. Never having
  had black bean soup before, let alone making it, I'm not sure what would be
  kosher to liven it up a bit. Anyone have any tips? I served it with
  cornbread and a plate of sliced home grown tomatoes. BTW, the recipe is
  transcribed exactly as it appears in the book to give a taste of Mickler's
  writing style. Pretty neat stuff, though I'm not sure if I'm ready for the
  cold collard sandwich yet...
  
  Salt and pepper to taste
  
  Put your beans in a soup pot and cover with water. Boil, take off the fire
  and let sit until cool. Cook onions and bell peppers in 1/2 the oleo until
  limp. Add them and the ham hocks and orange to the cooled beans; cover
  charitably with water. Simmer until beans is soft (1 to 2 hours). Fish out
  the orange right now, before it gets tore up. With the rest of the oleo,
  brown the flour in a black frying pan, then stir it into the beans. Brenda
  says: "Make sure you got a soup, now. If you need to add some more water,
  do it."

  NOTE:  I like to cut down a bit on the richness this soup has by using 2%
  milk; and Velveeta "Light" cheese.  Keep stirring-as it may burn.  Do not
  cook for more than 25 minutes as it becomes a great cheese sauce after a
  while-good for pouring over potatoes-but not good if you want soup.

      Title: Broccoli/mushroom Chowder
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  8
 
      2 lb Fresh broccoli
      8 oz Fresh mushrooms
      1 c  Butter
      1 c  Flour
      4 c  Chicken broth
      4 c  Half and half
      1 ts Salt (optional)
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1 ts Tarragon leaves, crushed.
 
  This recipe was submitted to Country Woman by Lorrie Arthur and it is
  delicious.
  
  Clean and cut broccoli into 1/2 inch pieces.  Steam in 1/2 cup water until
  tender/crisp (I nuke them for 3 to 4 minutes) do not drain.  Set aside.
  Clean and slice mushrooms.  In a large pan over medium heat, melt butter;
  add flour to make a roux.  Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 to 4 minutes;
  do not let brown.  Stir in chicken broth; bring just to a boil. Turn heat
  to low; add broccoli, mushrooms, half-and-half and seasonings. Heat through
  but do not boil.
  
  Makes 8 servings.
  
  NOTE:  This recipe works well cut in half.  Last night I made it using
  broccoli and mushrooms that had been taking up space in the reefer for
  awhile and were rubbery.  Still tasted great.  I usually serve with fresh
  bread (made of course in my bread machine.)

  Number of Servings:   6
  
  1.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate
  heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes.  Add the
  asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes.  Add the salt,
  pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to
  moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15 minutes.
  
  2.  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the
  heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly ladle
  about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking constantly.
  Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into the soup in the
  saucepan.  Increase the heat to moderately low and cook the soup, whisking
  constantly, until it just thickens, about 8 minutes.  Do not allow the soup
  to boil or the eggs will curdle.  Remove from the heat.
  
  3.  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl.  Ladle the hot
  soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian cooking, in
  which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from day-old or
  slightly stale bread.  Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.

  Rind and juice of 2 oranges Salt and pepper
  
  Grate the rind from the oranges.  Squeeze 1/4 cup fresh orange juice. Clean
  the carrots and trim the stems.  If the carrots are small, cook whole; if
  they are larger, cut into any shape so they will cook in about 10 minutes.
  Peel the turnips and cut into 1/2 inch pieces.  In a saucepan, cook the
  vegetables in the orange juice on slow heat until tender. Add the chicken
  stock and let the vegetables steep on a slow flame for another 10 to 15
  minutes.  Remove to a blender and puree until smooth; correct the
  seasonings.  Make a compound butter by combining the orange rind, honey,
  mustard and herbs with softened butter.  Halve the plums and then slice
  each half into thin slices that can be fanned out. Ladle the soup into
  bowls; garnish with a piece of the compound butter and the plums.

           Salt
 
  NOTE:  For a milder, sweeter tasting soup, substitute 8 ounces Swiss cheese
  for the cheddar cheese.
  
  Heat the butter in a large saucepan.  Add the carrots, celery, and onion;
  saute for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are softened.  Add the flour
  and cook over low heat until the flower is incorporated into the butter,
  about 1 minute.
  
  Stirring constantly, gradually add stock and then the cauliflower. Bring to
  a boil and simmer until the cauliflower is tender, or about 5 minutes. Stir
  in the grated cheese and cook for about 30 seconds until melted. (Do not
  bring soup to a boil after cheese is added or the soup will break.) Stir in
  the half-and-half; warm the soup over low heat. Season with cayenne pepper
  and 1 teaspoon salt or to taste.
  
  To serve, ladle the soup into warm soup bowls.  Sprinkle each portion with
  the diced cheese and serve immediately.
  
  Makes 4 seervings.

           Small croutons, fried
           -(in butter or oil)
           -(optional)
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Score chestnuts on their rounded sides and toss them
  in just enough oil to lightly coat them. Place chestnuts on baking sheet.
  Bake until skins have opened and meat is tender, about 20 minutes. When
  cool enough to handle, peel and dice them into small pieces. Set aside.
  Rinse lentils and combine them in soup pot with the water. Bring to boil.
  Cook a few minutes at gentle boil, removing foam that forms on surface. Add
  carrot, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaf, salt and parsley. Lower heat and
  simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes. When done, remove
  parsley sprigs and bay leaf. Correct seasoning and add salt, if necessary.
  Puree half the lentils until smooth, then recombine them with the rest.
  FINISHING THE SOUP: In pan large enough to hold soup, warm olive oil, then
  add roasted chestnuts and herbs. Cook over medium heat, stirring
  frequently, for several minutes. Add wine and tomato paste. Stir to
  dissolve tomato paste and cook a few minutes to reduce wine. Stir in lentil
  mixture and simmer gently 20 minutes. If soup is too thick, thin it with a
  little water, stock or cream until of right consistency. Taste for salt and
  season with pepper. Serve with spoonful of olive oil swirled into each
  bowl. Sprinkle with parsley and croutons, if desired.

      Title: Chestnut Soup with Amaretto
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  8
 
      2 lb Fresh chestnuts
      2    Carrots
      2    Parsnips
      1 sm Onion
      1 sm Clove garlic
      2    To 3 scallions
      3    Stalks celery, OR 1 small
           -celery root
      4 tb Butter
      5 c  Brown stock or chicken stock
      1    Bouquet garni of bayleaf,
           -thyme, and parsley
      3    To 4 Tbl amaretto or
           -hazelnut liqueur (like
           -Frangelico)
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste Cayenne pepper and freshly
  ground nutmeg
  
  Make a slash in the rounded side of each chestnut and roast in a preheated
  400 F oven for 5 minutes.  Peel off the shell and inner skin.
  
  Peel the carrots, parsnip, onion and garlic.  Finely chop all of the
  vegetables, including the scallions and celery.  Melt the butter in a large
  saucepan over medium heat.  Add the vegetables and cook for 5 minutes, or
  until soft but not brown.  Add the chestnuts, stock and bouquet garni.
  Gently simmer the soup for 40 minutes, or until the chestnuts are very
  soft.
  
  Remove the bouquet garni and puree the soup in a blender or food processor.
  Return the soup to the saucepan, adding the amaretto, 2/3 of the cream, and
  salt, pepper, cayenne pepper and nutmeg to taste; the soup should be very
  flavorful.  If a sweeter flavor is desired, add a spoonful of brown sugar.
  
  To serve, ladle the chestnut soup into warmed bowls.  Pour a little of the
  remaining cream into each bowl and marble it into the soup, stirring with a
  skewer.  Chestnut soup is extremely rich, so keep the rest of the meal
  simple.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      2 md Onions, diced

           -seeded and diced
      1    Thick slice crusty French or
           -Otalian bread
      3 sm Cloves garlic
      1    Egg
     12 oz Boned and skin cooked
           -chicken, coarsely diced
      4 oz Best quality smoked ham,
           -coarsely diced
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Small sprigs fresh basil
           -and/or parsley
           Unbleached all-purpose flour
           Salt to taste
 
  Bring the stock to a boil in a large soup pot.  Turn the heat down to low
  and let simmer, uncovered, while you continue.
  
  Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Add the onions and
  saute for 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the celery and carrot; saute for another 5
  minutes, then add the vegetables to the simmering chicken stock along with
  the tomato paste, brandy, turnip and butternut squash. Simmer gently,
  covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, make the meatballs.  In a food processor whizz together the
  bread, garlic and egg for about 30 seconds until a smooth paste is formed.
  Add the chicken, ham, pepper and the basil and/or parsley. Pulse-chop 10 to
  15 times, then process until a smooth, very thick paste is formed.
  
  Roll the meat paste into balls the size of a large marble.  Roll the balls
  in the flour so that they are lightly dusted all over.
  
  When the vegetables are tender, raise the heat slightly so that the soup
  simmers with a little more intensity.  Drop the meatballs into the soup and
  let cook for 5 to 7 minutes.  Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary.
  Be careful not to oversalt as the ham is salty.  Serve immediately.
  
  Serves 6 to 8 as an entre with bread and salad.
  
  NOTE:  This is even better the next day, but first remove the meatballs and
  wrap them separately rather than storing them overnight with the broth.

      Title: Chicken Noodle Soup New Orleans Style
 Categories: Soups, Chicken, Crockpot
   Servings:  6
 
      1 lg Whole fryer
      1 c  Diced onions
    1/2 c  Diced celery
    1/2 c  Minced parsley
      4    Cloves minced garlic
      1 c  Chopped carrots
      3    Bay leaves
      1 ts Poultry seasoning
      4 qt Bottled water (I used
           -regular tap water)
     12 oz Broad egg noodles
      2 tb Butter
      1 c  Sliced onion rings
      1 c  Sliced mushrooms (I left
           -these out)
      1 c  Diced carrots
    1/4 c  Cream sherry
 
  SOURCE: Cathy Keller.
  
  Tabasco sauce Salt and pepper to taste Green onions for garnish
  
  First, take the chicken and wash it thoroughly - that means both inside and
  out!  Remove the giblets, scrub out the internal cavity under cold running
  water, and scrape away anything that doesn't look edible. (But DO NOT
  remove the chicken skin or any of the fat!  You need the skin to make a
  rich stock.) Next, take a crock pot (see Note below if you don't have a
  crock pot) and place the chicken and giblets into it.  Then drop in the
  diced onions, the 1/2 c of celery, the 1/2 c of minced parsley, the garlic,
  chopped carrots, bay leaves, poultry seasoning and 2 quarts of water. Then,
  with a spoon, evenly distribute the seasoning mixture around the chicken,
  turn the crock pot to HIGH, and cook for at least six hours (or better
  still, OVERNIGHT).  Remember, the longer you cook, the richer the base
  stock and the more tender the chicken.  While the chicken is slow-cooking,
  it's a good time to prepare your noodles
  
  Go ahead and boil them according to package directions... but DO NOT COOK
  THEM UNTIL DONE!  Keep in mind that you're going to drop them into a soup,
  so you want them el dente (firm), otherwise they'll turn to pure mush by
  the time you eat them.  Furthermore, you want a small percent of the starch
  in the noodles to cook into the soup to thicken it slightly - if you cook
  the noodles all the way, the soup's consistency will be flat and thin.
  After the noodles are cooked, butter them slightly and set them aside. When
  the chicken is tender, take a set of tongs or a strainer spoon, remove it
  from the crock pot (it may tend to fall apart, but that's okay), and set it
  on a platter to cool.  At this point, strain out all the seasoning
  vegetables from the stock, place the stock into a metal bowl, and place the
  bowl into the refrigerator or freezer until the chicken fat congeals (which
  should take about 1 hour).  Meanwhile, pick the chicken off the bones and,
  with a sharp knife, chop it into bit-sized pieces. Then, in a heavy 12-inch
  skillet, melt the butter and saute the sliced onions, mushrooms, and
  carrots until they're tender.  Then drop in the chopped chicken meat. And
  over medium-low heat, cook it into the vegetables for about 10 minutes.
  While the chicken and vegetables are sauteing, remove the chicken stock
  from the refrigerator, skim off all the fat, and place the skimmed stock
  into a soup pot, along with the remaining 2 quarts of water. At this point,
  you should season the soup stock to taste with salt and pepper. Now drop in
  the sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onion rings and diced carrots - along with
  the sherry, the Tabasco*, and as soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the
  heat to low and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes to allow all the
  flavors to thoroughly blend. When you're ready to eat, ladle out heaping
  helpings of the piping hot soup into bowls, garnish with a sprinkling of
  thinly sliced green onions, and serve with crunch saltines.
  
  *I just put a couple of drops of Tabasco in there
  
  NOTE:  I found a REAL bargain on chicken hindquarters, so used them... was
  out of parsley, so omitted that.  USED the mushrooms and they are heavenly
  in it.  Didn't use the sherry, though I think it would be really good. And
  was out of flat noodles, so used a good handful of vermicelli broken into
  about 2" lengths, and just simmered in the soup.  It was REALLY good.

MMMMM----------------------HERBED TORTILLA CRISPS---------------------------
      3 lg Flour tortillas
           - cut into 12 sections each
      2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
      1 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  IN THE BOWL of a food processor fitted with a steel chopping blade, combine
  the peppers and garlic, and puree until smooth. Scrape the mixture into a
  large non-aluminum bowl. Add the chicken stock, buttermilk, sugar, salt,
  corn, nopales, oregano, and Tabasco, and stir to blend. Cover and chill for
  at least 1 hour. In a small bowl, combine the yogurt and oregano. Cover and
  refrigerate.
  
  TO MAKE THE CRISPS: Turn on your broiled, and position the rack at least 5
  inches from the heat. Lightly brush the top of the tortilla wedges with
  oil. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet. Sprinkle on the oregano,
  crumbling it with your fingers as you do this, then drizzle on the Parmesan
  cheese. Run them under the broiler, just to crisp and color lightly,
  watching so they do not burn. Before serving, ladle the soup into bowls.
  Add about a tablespoon of the yogurt in the center. Sprinkle on chopped
  oregano and serve with the tortilla wedges.
  
  NOTE: Although Tex-Mex and other Latin delicacies are now available in many
  markets across the country, pickled nopales or tender cactus leaves are
  less available than jalapeno peppers, for example. If you cannot find them,
  either chop a few pickled jalapeno peppers (with the seeds removed) or
  simply omit them.

  for 10-15 minutes at medium heat. Add the minced clams, not clam soup but
  clams, with their juice. Crumble the bacon and add. Cover soup and simmer
  over low heat, stirring occasionally, for several hours - up to five hours
  won't hurt. Cool down and place in refrigerator at night. On the day of
  serving, skim grease off top. Transfer soup to larger pot. Heat soup until
  bubbling and add the seafood seasoning. Mix 2 cups of the half and half
  with the flour. Add to the chowder and stir until it bubbles again. Mix in

      Title: Cock-A-Leekie
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  6
 
      8    Pieces of frying chicken (A
           -3 to 4-pound chicken should
           -do it.)
 
  Cock-a-Leekie
  
  A pound of beef shanks, hacked into stewing size  (about 1") 6 cups of
  chicken stock.  (Canned is ok, but it's better if you make your own ahead
  of time.) 3 slices of thick bacon or maybe salt pork, diced pretty fine. 1
  Tblsp dried thyme.  (Whole is better!) 1 bay leaf 3/4 cup pearl barley.
  (The kind you use in soup.) 1 1/2 cups of leeks. (Rinse and chop white
  parts only.) Salt and pepper as you require.
  
  You're going to need an 8-quart or better casserole that can stand up to
  the stove burners.  Bring the whole thing to a boil, (leave out the barley,
  leeks, salt and pepper.)  Simmer covered for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in
  another part of the forest, bring the barley to a boil in 1 1/2 cups of
  water for 10 min., drain and set it aside.  Debone the chicken when it's
  done and set it aside. Add the leeks to the pot along with the barley and
  simmer for 15 minutes. (Still with me?)  Then debone the beef and chop
  coarsely.  Dump the beef and the chicken back in the pot and simmer,
  covered, for 5 min. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.  Sing "Men of
  Harlech."   Pour a single malt.  Serve.
  
  And, if you're not up to Cock-a-Leekie ... In "A Moveable Feast" (sic)
  Ernest Hemingway offers the following leek recipe: Trim leeks, leaving just
  a smidgen of green and rinse them. Steam them for about 20 minutes or boil
  them for about the same time, until they are reasonably tender. Meanwhile,
  mix equal parts of extra-virgin olive oil and wine vinegar with a whisk in
  a bowl. When leeks are cooked, cut into quarters lengthwise and put them in
  a bowl of the oil/vinegar mix.  They should be just covered by the mix.
  Cover the bowl and put in refrigimagrator for an hour or so. (Overnight is
  even better, but St. David's Day is already upon us.)  Then dust them with
  a healthy dose of fresh-ground pepper and serve as a salad or side dish.

      Title: Cold Avocado and Buttermilk Soup
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  6
 
    1/3 c  Coarsely chopped sweet
           -onion, such as Vidalia
  2 1/2 c  Cold chicken broth, all fat
           -removed
      3    Thoroughly ripe avocados
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1    Drop almond extract
           -(optional)
      1 pn Of sugar (optional)
           Salt to taste
      2    Jalapeno peppers, seeds and
           -veins removed, diced
      3    To 5 tablespoons minced
           -cilantro
 
  Crisp tortilla chips to accompany
  
  Place the onions in a blender or processor and add 1 cup of the Puree as
  fine as possible. Peel and chunk in 2 1/2 of the avocados, reserving the
  remaining half for garnish. Puree again, adding broth as necessary.
  
  Transfer the soup to a large bowl. Add any remaining broth the buttermilk
  to the blender and whir briefly to pick as much avocado as possible. Add to
  the soup, along with the extract and sugar, if desired. Both of these
  rather surprising ingredients enhance avocado when used in tiny amounts.
  Stir well, taste and adjust the salt. The soup may be made to this in
  advance and refrigerated several hours, but for best flavor allow it to
  warm up a bit before serving. It should be cold but not icy.
  
  Peel the remaining half avocado cut into very thin slices. Divide
  soup-among six serving bowls and top with the sliced avocado, and
  coriander. Serve accompanied by the tortilla chips.

      2    Clove garlic
      1    Bay leaf
      1 pn Thyme
 
  Number of Servings:   8
  
  Make stock first.  Ten pounds of boiled crawfish make one pound of meat.
  Peel crawfish, reserving shells and claws.  Rinse shells and let drain.
  Melt butter in a large pot; add shells and fry until sizzling and hot,
  turning them often.  When shells are hot enough, heat a small pot, pour in
  brandy and ignite.  Remove shells from fire, pour in brandy, tossing and
  turning until the flame dies down.
  
  Add wine and water to cover shells.  Add onion, celery, green onions,
  parsley, garlic, thyme and bay leaf.  Let it all simmer for an hour. Strain
  carefully and reserve.
  
  In another pot, melt butter, add flour and let cook on low fire until
  medium brown.  Add chopped vegetables and let cook on a low fire until
  wilted, stirring often.  Chop tomatoes and add to pot with reserved liquid.
  Let cook a few minutes.
  
  Add stock -- just enough to make a soupy consistency -- then add
  Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, thyme, crawfish, corn and about four of the
  cobs (for added flavor).  Let simmer an hour.  Taste for salt, pepper and
  Tabasco.  If using boiled crawfish, it is usually peppery enough.
  
  Remove the cobs and serve.
  
  If the soup is too thick, add more stock or water.  If it's too thin, cook
  a little more flour and add to thicken it.
  
  Serves 8.
  
  NOTE:  If you prefer to buy crawfish tails already picked, buy a couple of
  pounds of boiled crawfish and pick them so as to have the shells to make
  your stock.  Shrimp may be substituted.

      Title: Cream of Cauliflower Soup (Veloute De Chor-Fleur)
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  6
 
      1 sm Head cauliflower
           Salt
      1 lg Leek, white part only
           Fresh ground white pepper
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Creme Fraiche
      2 tb Flower
      1 c  Croutons
  3 1/2 c  Boiling water
 
  Blanch the cauliflower:  break the head into flowerets and put them in a
  saucepan with cold water to cover.  Bring it to the boiling point, cook for
  one minute, drain, and rinse the flowerets under cold running water.
  
  Wash the leek, slice it into small rounds, and cook them in the butter
  until they are soft.  Stir in the flower, cook for a few minutes until it
  is golden, and add the boiling water.  Add the blanched cauliflower, season
  to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  Strain the soup through a food mill or puree it in a blender.  Stir in the
  creame fraiche, correct the seasoning, and serve with croutons.
  
  CREME FRAICHE: American heavy cream is considerably thinner than French
  heavy cream.
  
  Use 1 teaspoon of buttermilk for each cup of heavy cream.  Heat in a
  saucepan until it is lukewarm (about 85 F), pour into a glass container,
  and allow it to stand at room temperature until it thickens.  In very hot
  weather it can thicken in as little as 6 hours; in cold weather it can take
  as long as 36 hours.  This can be stored in the refrigerator for a least a
  week.

   Servings:  6
 
      1 lb Eggplant
           Salt
      2 oz Butter
      1 md Onion, finely diced
      2    Stalks celery, diced
      1 ts Curry powder
      1 pn Thyme
      1 pn Basil
      4 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Potato, diced
    1/2 c  Cream
 
  Salt Pepper Diced tomato, for garnish Chopped chives, for garnish
  
  Dice the eggplant but do not peel.  Sprinkle a little salt over the
  eggplant and leave to stand for about 30 minutes.  Put in a strainer and
  run a little water over the dice, pat dry.  This removes any bitter taste
  which would spoil the soup.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the onion, celery and eggplant.
  Saute', stirring occasionally until the vegetables have slightly softened.
  Eggplant absorbs butter very rapidly so you may have to add a little more
  or the vegetables will stick.
  
  Add the curry powder and fry to release the flavors.  Add thyme, basil,
  chicken stock and the potato.  Cover and simmer until the vegetables are
  quite soft, about 30 minutes.
  
  Put the soup through a sieve or moulin and add the cream.  Taste for
  seasoning.  Add a little diced tomato or chopped chives for garnish and
  color.
  
  This soup keeps well for several days.  However, if you intend making it
  beforehand and keeping it, only add the cream when you reheat it. It
  thickens as it stands, but it can be thinned with a little milk.

      Title: Cream of Mushroom Soup
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  8
 
      1 lb Mushrooms,rinsed & drained
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1    Large onion,chopped
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      6 c  Chicken broth,reg-strength
      1    Dried bay leaf
      1 c  Whipping cream
      3 tb Dry sherry
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Mushroom soup is so readily available in cans that it seldom occurs to the
  cook to make it from scratch. The canned product is, in fact, so universal,
  reliable, and chameleon-like in flavor that it has become the base of a
  thousand casseroles.
  If you seek a more intense mushroom flavor, however, look no further. Erid
  Lie, tooting his own horn, claims to have the answer to your prayers right
  here.
  Flour plays a part in the thickening of this soup, but the basic body and
  emphatic statement of mushroom flavor come from cooking part of the
  mushrooms with onions until they are mellow and lightly browned, then
  pureeing them.
  The flavor is further enhanced by adding sliced mushrooms before the final
  heating.
  ==========================================================================
  1. Chop half the mushrooms; thinly slice the remaining mushrooms and set
  aside.
  2. Melt butter in a 5-6 quart pan over medium-high heat; add chopped
  mushrooms, onion, and thyme. Stir often until the vegetables are lightly
  browned, 15-20 minutes. Mix flour with vegetables.
  3. Pour into a blender or food processor; whirl, adding as much broth as
  needed to get the mixture smoothly pureed. Pour mixture back into pan; add
  remaining broth, sliced mushrooms, bay leaf, and cream.
  4. Bring soup to a boil on high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to
  low and simmer to blend flavors, about 10 minutes. Add sherry, salt, and
  pepper to taste. Make about 8 cups.

      Title: Cucumber Soup with Pistou
 Categories: Vegetables, Soups
   Servings:  6
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Leek (white part plus 1 inch
           -of green) chopped
      1    Stalk celery with leaves,
           -chopped
      1 lb Cucumbers, peeled, halved,
           -seeded, and chopped
      2 ts Lemon juice
      4 c  Chicken stock
           Pistou:
      2    Cloves garlic, finely minced
    1/4 c  Minced fresh basil
      4 ts Finely chopped walnuts
      2 ts Parmesan cheese
      4 ts Olive oil
    1/2 md Sized tomato, peeled,
           -seeded, and chopped
 
  To prepare the soup: In a medium-size saucepan, heat oil over low heat. Add
  leeks and celery and cook until vegetables are soft, about 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.  Add cucumbers, lemon juice and stock. Bring to a
  boil over medium heat.  Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, or
  until cucumbers are tender.  Cool slightly. To prepare Pistou: With a
  mortar and pestle, mash together garlic, basil and walnuts to a paste. (you
  can also use a bowl with a wooden spoon). Work in a little cheese and oil
  and one-third of the tomato.  Keep adding cheese, oil and tomato.  The
  mixture will not be a true emulsion but a barely fluid paste.
  
  Transfer cucumber mixture to a food processor or blender and puree, in
  batches, until smooth.  Ladle soup into serving bowl.  Pass the pistou.
  Allow 1 tablespoon of pistou per serving to be placed in the center of the
  bowl, then swirl into soup.

      Title: Downtown Black Bean Soup
 Categories: Beans, Soups
   Servings:  6
 
      2    And 1/2 quarts water or
           -vegetable stock and stir
           -into it
      2 c  Black beans and 2 bay
           -leaves.
 
  Bring to a boil
  
  Turn down the heat and let simmer a couple of hours until the beans start
  to get tender, then heat 1/4 to 3/4 cup olive oil (how much will your
  conscience allow?) and cook in it until tender but not browned
  
  3 onions, chopped 2 green peppers, chopped 1 fresh jalepeno pepper, chopped
  (optional) 4 to 6 cloves of garlic, pressed 1 to 3 teaspoons salt, maybe
  more (taste it)
  
  Stir this mixture into the simmering black beans and let cook until quite
  tender and flavorful. More salt may be needed, and if you have a chance to
  let the soup sit overnight at this point, it will be even better. If
  desired, puree half or all of this to smoothness; we like it half-pureed,
  half-chunky. If you do puree it, be sure to reheat it before serving it,
  either as is or Cuban-style: bowls of steaming hot white rice and dishes of
  chopped raw onions are on the table, and each person stirs as much or as
  little rice and onions as they wish into their soup.

  and cover with 1,000 gallons of brown gravey and simmer for 4 weeks.
  
  Shovel in salt and pepper to taste.  When the meat is tender, add the
  vegetables.
  
  A steam shovel is useful for this.
  
  Simmer slowly for four more weeks.  Garnish with parsley.
  
  If more are expected, add the two rabbits - this is not recommened, as very
  few people like hare in their stew.

   Servings:  1
 
      1 lb Dried peas
      8 c  -Water
    1/2 lb Salt pork-all in one piece
      1    Onion, large;chopped
    1/2 c  Celery;chopped
    1/4 c  Carrots;grated
    1/4 c  Parsley; fresh,chopped
      1    Bay leaf;small
      1 ts Savory, dried
           -Salt and Pepper
 
  "Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more
  vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with
  small dumplings. This soup is very good reheated.. The most authentic
  version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with salt pork
  and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually chopped and
  returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice thinly and served
  sepaprately. Instead of fresh or dried herbs, herbes salees (herbs
  preserved with salt) are often used; they are available commercially or
  made at home.
    Pea soup remains a popular dish in resturants where tourists enjoy a true
  taste of old Quebec. In some variations, a little garlic, leeks, other
  vegetables or a ham bone are added for flavour. For a thicker consaistency
  (though this is not traditional) a cup or two of cooked peas can be pureed
  then returned to the soup."
  
  Wash and sort peas; soak in cold water ovvernight. Drain and place in a
  large pot; add water, parsley, salt pork, onion, celery, carrots, parsley,
  bay leaf, savory and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer
  until peas are very tender, about 2 hours, adding more water if needed.
  Remove salt pork; chop and return to soup. Discard bay leaf. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. MAKES 8 SERVING: SOURCE: "The First Decade"

  MY WAY:  Start a loaf of French Bread in the bread machine so it is
  finished about 15 min. before you want to eat.  Slice onion or chop (not
  too fine) in a food copper.  Use water instead of wine and leave out the
  flour.  Add 1 tsp extra liquid bouillon (eg. Oxo). If you don't have fresh
  bread to serve on the side, dry croutons (bread cubes) are good on top of
  the soup.  Sprinkle with parmesan. WARNING: Guests may fill up on the
  bread/soup and not have room for dinner!

      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Salted herbs;*

  "If there was one dish that could be called typically Acadian, it would
  certainly be Fricot, a soup containing potatoes and meat. The dish has been
  a long time favorite in Acadian households, so much  that the word fricot
  was once synonymous with a good meal and a common call for dinner was
  often, "Vous etes invites au fricot!"... This potato fricot was prepared
  when neither meat nor fish were available, and given the tongue-in-cheek
  name, "Weasel Fricot" (Fricot a la Belette). If you ask Acadians about the
  origin of the name, they will smile and say, "Parce que b'lette a passe
  tout drouete (Because the weasel went right on by.) On Prince Edward it is
  called Fricot a la bezette (Nincompoop Fricot) where bezette roughly
  translates as "nincompoop". It is known as butter fricot, salted her fricot
  and potato fricot, and is often served with a large slice of buttered bread
  and molasses."
  
  Handkerchief Dumplings (Pates en Mouchior de Poche) Mix flour with salt.
  Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making biscuits.
  Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and place the
  squares in the fricot. Cover and simmer 7 minutes.
  
  Saute the onion and salted herbs in butter for 1-2 minutes or until the
  onion is golden brown. Add the water, potatoes, salt and pepper, and simmer
  for 20 minutes. To thicken the broth, add dumpling or flour mixed with
  water.

 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  1
 
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 sm Clove garlic or 1/2 large,-
           -peeled and crushed
      1 sl Cuban or French bread
      1 ea Egg
           Salt and freshly ground-
           -pepper to taste
      1 ts Minced parsley
      2 ts Grated hard queso blanco-
           -(see Note) or Parmesan-
           -cheese
 
  Bring the chicken broth to a boil.  In a small skillet, heat the oil.  Add
  the garlic and saute until golden and aromatic.  Place the bread in a large
  soup bowl, pour the oil and garlic over it, add the boiling chicken broth,
  and immediately break the egg into the soup.  It will cook in 2 to 3
  minutes.  Add salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the parsley and cheese.
  
  NOTE:  There are dozens of quesos blancos, or white cheeses, which is
  exactly how the name translates.  Some are soft, some fresh, but many aged.
  Queso blanco generally is mild flavored, though some of the aged ones can
  be quite tangy.  They are found in markets in Florida and in most cities
  with colonies of residents of Caribbean, Cuban, or Mexican ancestry. Try
  the cheeses, and choose the one that suits your taste.

      2    Medium onions, chopped
      2 c  Pared, diced potatoes
      1 qt Whole milk

  HADDOCK CHOWDER From America:
  
  Have the haddock cleaned and cut up to boil.  Barely cover with salted
  water and cook until the fish comes off the bones. Don't cook until the
  flesh is soft and mushy. Set aside to cool.
  
  While fish is cooling, cut the pork into 1/4" cubes and fry until crisp in
  a large heavy kettle. Drain the cubes on paper towels and pour off all but
  4 tbls of the fat. In this fat, cook the chopped onions over low heat until
  trnasparent.  Add the potatoes and enough of the fish liquor to cover them.
  Simmer gently until potatoes are cooked.
  
  Pick the fish flakes from the bones, adding to the chowder mixture when the
  potatoes are done.  Add quart of milk and evaporated milk. Set aside until
  serving time.
  
  It imporves the flavor of the chowder greatly to let it stand for several
  hours before serving.  Be sure it is piping hot when bringing it to the
  table.
  
  Biscuits and pickles always go with a good chowder.

  Before making her name as CNN's sole female sportscaster, Hannah Storm was
  famous for her misadventures in the kitchen. "When I was younger, my
  brothers used to make fun of me," says Storm. "Once, I was following this
  wonderful chocolate-coffee bundt cake recipe, and I used a cup of
  freeze-dried coffee grounds. The joke circulated around the family for
  years, 'I ate a piece of Hannah's cake and was up for two days straight'."~
  Storm has since honed her culinary skills. One dish she's mastered is her
  mother's famous pumpkin soup. "This soup was always a mystery soup for
  anyone outside of the family," says Storm. "My mother never liked to tell
  people what was in it because they probably wouldn't try it."~ ~ * - not
  pie filling~ ~ In a large soup pot, saute onion and mushrooms in butter for
  1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in flour. Add chicken broth and
  pumpkin. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Stir in
  cream, honey, nutmeg and serve.~ ~ OPTIONAL GARNISH: Sprinkle with croutons
  or crispy chinese noodles and Parmesan cheese.

   Cook covered (25 min in microwave).  This soup freezes and reheats very
  well.
  
   This will take some experimenting but I could make it at the same time as
  a stir fry and freeze the soup in plastic ice cube trays instead of
  freezing half the package of raw liver.
  
  Have you tried it using a creamed soup?
  
  I'm not all that fond of cooked tomatoes, but it looks like it might be
  good using something like cream of Cheddar...
  
  Also... were you using beef or chicken or what?
  
  Also... how about some diced potatoes...?
  
  OTOH...  Let's eliminate the butter and use bacon...  Turns it into a

      Title: Hernekeitto
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  6
 
    1/2 lb Dried Whole Green Peas
      2 qt Cold Water
      1 lb Pork Leg
      1 ts Dried Marjoram
      1 pn Dry Mustard
      1 ds Salt
      1 ds Ground Pepper
 
  This Finnish pea soup can be made well in advance. You can double or triple
  the recipe and freeze it in useful quantities. Malla Karhusaari also
  suggests reducing the cooking time by using a pressure cooker or microwave
  to prepare it. Rinse peas and soak in cold water in large port for 8 hours
  or overnight. Bring peas and soaking water to the boil, reduce to a simmer
  and cook for one hour or until peas begin to soften. Add pork and continue
  to simmer for two to three hours, until peas and meat ar thoroughly cooked.
  When meat is tender, remove it from pot, discard skin and bone, cut meat in
  cubes and return to soup. You may need to add more water to pot for desired
  consistency. Season with marjoram, mustard, salt and pepper. Heat to blend
  flavors and serve hot. Serves 6. From The Gazette, 91/01/30.

    1/2 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
           Bread Croutons, For Garnish

MMMMM--------------------------FOR COLD SOUP-------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Cold Milk
      6 tb Chives, Chopped
    1/4 ts Tabasco Sauce
 
  Remove the root end and any damaged outer leaves from the leek, but leave
  the remainder of the leaves intact.  Split the leek in half lengthwise, and
  cut it into 1/2-inch pieces.  Clean the leek by immersing the pieces in a
  bowl filled with cold water.  Lift the pieces from the water and place them
  in a sieve to drain.  Heat the oil in a pot. When hot, add the leek and
  sliced onion, and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until they
  soften and begin to brown lightly.  Add the stock, potatoes, salt and
  pepper, and bring to the boil.  Boil for 30 to 40 minutes, until the
  potatoes are tender.  Strain off most of the cooking juices and reserve
  them. Add the solids with a little of the juices to the bowl of a food
  processor, and process briefly, just until pureed.  (If too much liquid is
  added to the processor bowl, the mixture will become too foamy.) Stir the
  puree into the reserved juices.  You should have about 7 cups. The hot soup
  can be served immediately, either plain or with croutons. FOR COLD SOUP:
  Cool the soup and stir in the milk, chives and Tabasco sauce. Serve cold.
  Serves 6. *If you cannot find leeks, add additional onions or scallions;
  the soup will be very good, although it won't have the unique taste that
  leeks give to soup.  If using leeks or scallions, be sure to make use of
  the green as well as the white part of the vegetables, after trimming them
  first, of course, to eliminate any damaged or wilted sections. The green
  leaves lend color as well as taste and texture to the soup. Recipe from

      Title: Leftovers To Save for Soup (Soup Information)
 Categories: Soups, Information
   Servings:  6
 
      5    Minutes for zucchini or tiny
           -broccoli orcauliflower
           -flowerets.
 
  Any leftovers in cans should be transfered to plastic containers - atwist
  of foil or plastic in the case of anchovies, tomato paste, or pimientos -
  and frozen. Vegetable cooking water (freeze) Leftover vegetables (can be
  frozen, but better if not) Noodles, rice, pasta, kasha, beans (freeze)
  Cream sauce, spaghetti sauce, gravy (freeze)
  
  Before freezing leftover vegetable water, stock, broth, or tomato product,
  cook some finely chopped onion, celery, and carrot in 1 - 2 Tbsp of butter
  until they soften, then add the liquid and salt and pepper. Freeze the
  mixture and you will have soup starter.  Use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of each
  vegetable for 6 cups of soup.
  
  Variations on the soup starter:
  
  Before adding the vegetables, cook 2 slices of diced bacon in the butter.
  
  Add 1 Tbsp paprika, chili powder, or curry powder to the vegetables as they
  cook, before adding liquid:  1 Tbsp of flour can be added at this time,
  too, to give the starter a little body.
  
  Sherry or dry red or white wine, about 1/3 cup, can be added before the
  other liquid and allowed to cook down to half.  This gives a richness to
  the soup that will ensue.
  
  Add 2 Tbsp of finely chopped parsley to the vegetables.
  
  Add 1/3 cup of finely chopped green pepper.
  
  Once you have the starter, the rest of the liquid can be added.  It can be
  more of the same, or perhaps milk.  Heavy cream, yogurt, or sour cream are
  added at the end, to heat but not boil, to avoid curdling.
  
  The solids you put in can be infinitely varied:
  
  Small pieces of stewing meat or soaked dried beans need about an hour to
  cook.
  
  Fresh vegetables take from about 20 minutes for root vegetables to about
  
  Cooked vegetables should be put in just to warm, not to cook any further.
  If they are already overcooked, perhaps it would be better to add a little
  liquid and puree them.
  
  Soup can be thickened by pureeing some or all of it, or for each cup of
  soup add 1 tsp of rice or 3 Tbsp of grated raw potato or 1 Tbsp of flour
  mixed with 2 Tbsp milk, water, or broth.
  
  Finely chopped cabbage can cook for hours in a soup, spinach goes in at the
  very end, for about a minute, remaining bright green.
  
  Cooked ham, in chunks or julienne, sliced frankfurters, and sliced garlic
  sausage have more flavor and give up some of their fat if they are lightly
  sauteed before being added to the soup.

    1/2 c  Butter
      3 c  Diced onions
    1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
      2 ts Minced garlic
    1/2 c  Flour
     12 c  Concentrated fish stock
      4 lb Chowder fish fillets, such
           -as 2 lbs. cod, 1 lb.
           -monkfish and
      1 lb Cusk (note from Al: I
           -believe any firm white fish
           -will do)
      2 c  Light cream
    1/2 c  Finely grated Monterey Jack
           -cheese
 
  salt freshly ground black pepper
  
  Heat the butter in a large saucepan until softened, and saute the onions,
  carrots and garlic in it, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Remove
  from heat and slowly stir in the flour.  Return to the heat, and cook,
  stirring, for about 4 minutes.  Meanwhile, begin heating the stock in a
  large pot.  Whisk the stock into the flour mixture.  Bring the stock to a
  boil, whisking constantly, then reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.
  
  Add the fish and simmer about 10 minutes longer.  Stir in the cream and
  cheese, and simmer until the cheese melts, about 5 to 8 minutes. (You won't
  distinguish the cheese as such, it is incorporated in the chowder.) Reheat
  the chowder slowly so the cream doesn't boil.
  
  Makes about 3 quarts.

      Title: Lentil Tomato Soup
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  6
 
    2/3 c  Dried lentils, washed and
           -picked over
      4 c  Water
      1    Onion, chopped
      4    Carrots, chopped
      2    Stalks celery, chopped
           A few Baco-bits (optional)
      1 c  Tomato paste
 
  A hearty and nutritious soup--high in protein--that does not take long to
  make and tastes as though it took all day.
  
  Chopped parsley Garlic Salt and pepper Thyme, dill weed, and tarragon - to
  taste Dry white wine (optional)
  
  Put the first 6 ingredients (lentils, water, onion, carrots, celery, and
  Baco-bits if you are using them) into a large pot and simmer gently for
  about 3 hours, replenishing the water as needed.  If you have a taste for
  it, try adding a little dry white wine.  Then, tasting to see what quantity
  is right for you, add very small amounts of the herbs and spices. Finally,
  stir in a cup of tomato paste and let it all heat through.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  MY NOTES:  I never used the Baco-bits or the white wine with this soup. The
  lentils do not need to soak.  If you forget and soak them anyway, just cut
  the simmering time a little.  Be sure to check the water level. This
  becomes a very nice rich, thick stew-like soup, and can burn quickly. The
  tomato paste adds a nice tang which benefits the lentils a lot. If I
  remember right (it has been six months or so since I've made this), I am
  not sure I used all the tomato paste they call for...  I think I may have
  just opened a 6-oz. can and put that in (8 oz. is a cup, so I would be just
  shy a little).  Don't think it makes a lot of difference... just add the
  tomato paste to taste.  ;-) This is a very pretty soup (lentils being
  pretty much just brownish, the carrots and onions and celery bits all some
  nice color to it, and the tomato paste makes it have a kind of reddish
  glow), and is nice served with a hearty slice of whole grain bread ...
  especially on a cold winter night!

    1/8 ts Nutmeg - fresly grated
      1 pt Oysters - shucked, with
           -their liquor
    1/4 c  Parsley - finely chopped
 
  1.  Trim off the root ends and most of the green part of the leeks. Reserve
  the white part of the leeks plus a small part of the green. Split the white
  part in half and rinse thoroughly between the leaves.
  
  2.  Cut the leeks lengthwise into thin strips and then crosswise into very
  small cubes.  There should be about 5 cups.
  
  3.  Peel the potatoes and cut them lengthwise in half.  Cut each half
  crosswise into very thin slices.  There should be about 4 cups.
  
  4.  Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan and add the chopped leek.
  Cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes.  Add the potatoes and water and
  bring to a boil.  Add salt and pepper.  Simmer for 20 minutes. Drain in a
  colander.  Reserve both the liquid and solids.
  
  5.  Meanwhile, finely grate the cheese.  There should be about 1 cup.
  
  6.  Heat the oil and remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy skillet and
  add the bread cubes.  Cook, shaking the skillet and stirring, until the
  cubes are golden brown.  Drain in a sieve.
  
  7.  Put the leek and potato solids in a food processor or blender. Blend
  thoroughly while adding small amounts of the reserved cooking liquid. Add
  only enough liquid to make a fine puree.
  
  8.  Combine the puree with the remaining liquid in a kettle and bring to a
  simmer.  Add the cream and salt and pepper to taste.  Add the nutmeg and
  heat thoroughly.
  
  9.  Add the oysters with their liquor and cook briefly or just until the
  oysters curl.  Serve sprinkled with the parsley and with the croutons and
  cheese on the side.

  From an article by Louise Tennent Smith.
  
  "Making soup is fun, an exercise in kitchen creativity which cannot go
  wrong---you can ALWAYS fix a soup.
  
  "Homemade stock is good, and easy to make, though time consuming. But don't
  give up on soup making if you haven't time to make your own. There are good
  canned. dried and frozen bases that will allow you to whip up a good soup
  in no time at all.
  
  "Seasoning:  The stock itself gives the base seasoning to a soup, as do
  herbs and spices added during the cooking.  The addition of wine frequently
  enhances the flavor.  Add about one-quarter cup to one quart of soup just
  before serving, and do not boil after adding.  Use sherry for light soups
  with a chicken base, red wine with beef based soups, white wine with fish
  soups.  A cup of beer for every three cups of soup is good with bean and
  other hearty vegetable soups.
  
  "Thickening:  Cooked cereals such as rice, noodles and dumplings give body
  to a clear soup; added raw, they will thicken a soup.  Other thickeners
  include egg yolks, pureed vegetables and roux of flour and butter.
  
  "Color:  Soups using a good quantity of meat, onion skims, tomato skins or
  browned onions usually have excellent color.  Other color additives include
  browning sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, wine, tomato sauce and soy
  sauce.  The latter group should be used with great care in delicate soups,
  as their flavor might be overwhelming."

      Title: Mama Bina's Italian Chicken Soup
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  6
 
      1    Stewing chicken, cut into
           -pieces
      2    Whole carrots, finely diced
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley (preferably
           -Italian parsley)
      3 c  To 4 c cooked pastina or
           -rice
 
  FROM:      Shelley Rodgers (Jolly Rodgers:the Portuguese Pirate!
  (1:161/202))
  
  This recipe came from an unknown magazine.  Judging from the comments that
  accompanied the recipe, apparently the magazine was running a Chicken
  Recipe contest.
  
  Mama Bina's Italian Chicken Soup No Chicken Recipe Contest worth its
  bouillon would be complete without a recipe for chicken soup. This recipe
  was submitted by Renata Pagliaro and Maureen Vieck of Cuperino, CA. Renata
  writes: "I can remember as a child my mother would prepare chicken soup at
  least once a week for dinner.  Typical of children, I thought that soup was
  boring (hardly to be compared to a hot dog!) and I also thought it was some
  strange dish that only Italians ate.
  
  "Now that I am older and ore sophisticated (enough to even like spinach!),
  I have come to appreciate my mother's chicken soup. It is delicate and so
  simple taht it is actually elegant.  To top all of that, it is easy to
  make, nutritious and low in calories."
  
  salt to taste
  
  Wash the chicken pieces and remove as much skin as possible.  Put the
  chicken into a large dutch oven, fill with water and cook over high heat.
  When the water boils, skim off the foam that comes to the surface and
  discard.
  
  When no more foam appears, put the carrots and parsley into the pot with
  the chicken. Lower the heat to a simmer so taht the water doesn't boil
  down. Do not cover. Add salt to taste and check every so often for flavor.
  
  Allow to cook for 1-1/2 hours.  You may prepare rice or pastina in the
  meantime and set it aside.  After soup has cooked, remove the chicken from
  the pot with a slotted spoon.  Take the chicken off the bones and tear into
  bite-sized pieces and place back into the broth.
  
  Put the cooked and strained pastina or rice into the soup and allow to heat
  through.  Just before serving, you may add a little butter for flavor.
  
  Serve hot with a crusty French bread and a bottle of white wine.  This soup

      Title: Monterey Clam Chowder
 Categories: Soups, Crockpot
   Servings:  6
 
      1    Carrot, diced (1)
      1 md Onion, diced (1 1/2)
      1    Potato, diced (2)
      1    Stalk of celery, diced (2)
    1/2 lb Minced bacon (3/4 lb.)
    1/4 lb Margarine (I used butter, 1
           -1/2 cubes)
      3    Cloves fresh garlic, minced
           -(5)
    1/2 qt Clam juice (I used 3- 8 oz
           -bottles)
  1 1/2 c  Flour (2 1/4 c.)
      2 c  Milk (3 c.)
      2 c  Heavy whipping cream (3 c.)
      2 c  Half-and-half (3 c.)
    1/2 ts Black pepper (1 tsp., DON'T
           -SALT!)
    1/2 lb Chopped clams (fresh, frozen
           -or canned) (3 lb. can)
    1/2 ts Clam base (optional,
           -available in most gourmet
           -shops)
 
  (I made 1 1/2 times this amount - see parenthesis for amt.)
  
  Place vegetables, bacon and margarine in a 5 quart sauce pot. Saute over
  medium heat until vegetables are tender.  Be careful not to brown or
  scorch.
  
  When vegetables are tender, add flour to make a roux.  Cook for two
  minutes, allowing flour to cook while stirring occasionally.
  
  Add clam juice and dairy products.  Stir by using a wire whip.
  
  Add fresh garlic, black pepper, chopped clams and clam base. Cook over
  low-medium heat stirring occasionally to prevent chowder from scorching.
  Cook for two hours or until chowder is brought to desired thickness.
  
  If a crockpot, or small steam kettle is available, it is recommended. Also,
  clam juice can be added to thin chowder down if it gets too thick.
  
  Note:  This soup is the BEST clam chowder I have ever tasted! It is thick
  and very rich and fattening! I didn't use the clam base since I don't even
  know what that is. Also, I didn't need to simmer it as long as suggested. I
  cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. The chowder needs to be stirred OFTEN,
  probably about every 5-10 minutes or so or it will stick to the bottom of
  the pot.  Also, I one-and-one-halved times'd it, using about 3 lbs. of
  chopped clams instead of the recommended amount.  I also served it with the
  little soup "clam" crackers. It made about 5 quarts this way. Deb C.

     15    To 20 lbs. fresh or frozen
           -turtle meat
      6    Carrots
      4    Onions
      1    Stalk celery, diced fine
    1/2    Gal. Burgundy
      4    To 5 gals. Povirade sauce
      1 lb Gelatin
           Stock pot:
      1 tb Marjoram
      2 ts Gumbo file
      1 ts Coriander
      6    Bay leaves
      1    Kitchen spoon ground mace
    1/2 oz Spanish Saffron
      1 lb Whole anise
     10    Whole lemons
 
  veal bones
  
  Boil turtle meat until tender; reduce stock and clarify. Add ingredients
  for stock pot. To stock pot add carrots, onions, celery, Burgundy, and
  Povirade sauce. Tighten with gelatin. This recipe will yield approximately
  10 gallons. Under refrigeration, the soup will hold for several weeks.
  
  Well, I hope this recipe helps in the use of turtles, though I suspect you
  will have to have a very large family or like turtle soup a lot, or scale
  the recipe to a more manageable quantity.

 Categories: Soups
   Servings: 10
 
      1 c  Baked ham,finely chopped
      1 c  Chicken,cooked,chopped
           Tomato juice
      2    Fatty bacon slices
      1    Onion,large,peeled/chopped
      6    Tomatoes,large,fresh,chopped
      1 tb Worchestershire sauce
    1/2 ts Mustard,dry
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  1. Grind ham and chicken, a little at a time, with just enough tomato juice
  to keep mixture from clogging blender, or put meats through medium blade of
  meat grinder without tomato juice. Set aside.
  2. Fry bacon in a large, heavy skillet over low heat until crisp. Remove
  bacon, drain, and crumble. Set aside.
  3. In bacon fat in skillet, cook onion until soft. Add tomatoes and ground
  ham and chicken. Cook until tomatoes are very soft. Stir in seasonings and
  crumbled bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  Serves 8-10 with barbecued meat; 6 as shortcake.
  NOTE: Mrs. Neal Leuty, one of Plains' best cooks, serves this unusual and
  unusually good stew in two ways; as an accompaniment to barbecued fresh
  pork or chicken along with potato salad, or served with corn bread squares,
  split and toasted, as a main course shortcake. Believe me - and you will
  when you try it - this is positively scrumptious served either way.

      Title: Mulligatawny Soup
 Categories: Soups, Poultry
   Servings:  6
 
      4 c  Chicken broth (canned or
           -home-made, recipe below)
      2 c  Chopped cooked chicken [I
           -just boiled 1 whole chicken
           -&
           Used the whole thing]
     16 oz Can tomatoes, cut up,
           -undrained
      1 md Cooking apple, peeled and
           -chopped (1 cup)
    1/4 c  Finely chopped onion
    1/4 c  Chopped carrot
    1/4 c  Choppe celery
    1/4 c  Chopped green pepper
      1 tb Snipped parsley
      2 ts Lemon juice
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2    To 1 tsp curry powder
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    3/4 ts Salt
      1 ds Pepper
 
  In a large saucepan combine broth, chicken, undrained tomatoes, apple,
  onion, carrot, celery, green pepper, parsley, lemon juice, sugar, curry,
  ground cloves, salt and pepper.  Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover;
  simmmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.
  
  CHICKEN STOCK: Bony chicken pieces (backs, necks & wings) from 2 chickens 3
  stalks celery with leaves, cut up 1 carrot, cut up 1 large onion, quartered
  1 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper 3 whole cloves 6 cups cold water
  
  In a large stockpot or Dutch oven place chicken pieces, celery, carrot,
  onion, salt, pepper and cloves.  Add the water.  Bring to boiling. Reduce
  heat; cover and simmer for 1 hour.  Remove chicken. Strain stock. Discard
  vegetables.  Clarify stock, if desired (see note below). If using the stock
  while hot, skim fat.  (OR, chill stock and lift off fat. [*much, much*
  easier, if you have the time to chill it, IMHO]).
  
  Makes about 4 1/2 cups stock.
  
  CROCK POT DIRECTIONS: Use ingredients as above, except use only 4 cups
  water.  Combine all ingredients in an electric slow crockery cooker. Cover;
  cook on low-heat setting for 8 to 10 hours. Strain stock. Discard
  vegetables.  Continue as directed above.
  
  NOTES ON CLARIFYING STOCK: Clarify beef or chicken stock for a clear soup.
  Clarifying remove solid flecks that are too small to be strained out with
  cheesecloth, but that will muddy a soup's appearance. To clarify, combine
  1/4 cup cold water, 1 egg white and 1 eggshell, crushed. Add to stained
  stock; bring to boiling. Remove from heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Strain
  again through a sieve line with cheesecloth.
  
  [My notes:  I usually don't have a bunch of 'bony' chicken pieces laying
  around the house.  When I make my chicken stock, I just throw the whole
  darn chicken in the pot, cover it with water and boil for 1 hour.  If I
  have the vegies to put in, wonderful; if not, tuff luck.  Even without the
  vegies in the stock, the Mulligatawny is very good.  Not too hot or spicy,
  but very flavorful.  The cut-up vegetables really fill up the soup bowl and
  your tummy, as well!  Well worth the effort to make.  -sr]

 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  5
 
    1/2 lb Dried navy beans
      4 tb Olive oil
      1    Onion, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
      3    Ribs celery, diced
      1    Turnip, diced
      1 sm Imported bay leaf and 5
           -sprigs fresh
           Parsley, tied together with
           -kitchen twine
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
    1/4 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      6 c  Chicken broth
      4    Fresh sausages (mild
           -Italian)
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Soak the navy beans overnight in plenty of cold water; the next day drain
  the beans and rinse them under cool water.  Set aside.  Place the oil and
  onion in a soup kettle, set over low heat and cook slowly until the onion
  has softened, about 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to medium, add the garlic
  and celery and stir-cook for 1 minute.  Drop in the bay leaf and parsley
  bundle.  Stir in the allspice, red pepper flakes, broth, and navy beans.
  Bring the soup base to a boil, skimming it as necessary; boil 3 minutes.
  Cover and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, or until the beans are quite tender.
  Discard the parsley-bay leaf bundle.  (The soup may be prepared in advance
  to this point.)
  
  To finish the soup, grill the sausages under the broiler or pan-fry them
  for about 20 minutes, letting them cook for 10 minutes on each side. Slice
  the sausage into 1/3-inch disks.  Add the sausage rounds to the soup and
  let simmer for 5 minutes longer to blend the flavors.  Season with salt and
  freshly-ground pepper to taste.  Ladle the soup into warm bowls and serve
  piping hot.
  
  Makes 5 servings.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  8
 
      4    Sprigs parsley
      1    Leek
    1/2    Carrot; cut lengthwise
      1    Stalk celery; chopped
    1/4    Bay leaf
      1 pn Sage
      1 pn Thyme
      2    Thick slices bacon, diced
      1 c  New corn pulp
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped fine
    1/2 c  Celery; chopped fine
      4 c  Chicken broth
    3/4 c  Raw potatoes; diced
  1 1/2 c  Tomatoes; peeled & chopped
      1 pn Cayenne pepper
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Cornstarch
 
    "The key to this delicious soup is to gently scrape the kernels off the
  corn cob with a table fork so the skins remain on the cob, leaving you with
  only the fresh pulp."
  
    Use a 12" square of cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni of the first 7
  ingredients and set aside.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, first
  soften the bacon, then add the corn, onions, and celery and saute until
  tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken broth, potatoes, tomatoes, and
  the bouquet garni. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and slow boil for 1 hour.
  Remove the bouquet garni.  Add the cayenne pepper.  Meanwhile, using your
  fingers, dissolve the cornstarch in heavy cream at room temperature.  Add
  cornstarch/cream mixture to soup and stir until heated through.
  
  This recipe comes from the A. T. &  S. F.  RR.

  Separate clams from liquor, discard dark stomach contents, and mince clams.
  Fry pork to a golden brown, then add sliced onions, and fry these to a
  light golden color.  Add a layer of potatoes and sprinkle with flour, salt,
  and pepper.  Add boiling water and simmer until the potatoes are done.
  Combine milk, clam liquor, and butter before adding to clam mixture. Simmer
  for 5 minutes.  Serve with crackers.
  
  NOTE:  For those who cannot buy fresh clams, I think two 6-ounce cans would
  be plenty.

  Wash the beans well in cold water several times, then place in a large,
  heavy stew pot and cover with water. Allow to soak overnight. The next
  morning (start early - beans like to take their time), pour off the soaking
  water, and ham bone, 8 cups of water, onion and seasonings. Put on the back
  of the stove and let simmer gently until beans are very tender, usually
  about 4 hours. Add more water if needed. Remove and discard ham bone. If
  the water looks a bit scant pour in 1-2 cups more. When beans are good and
  tender remove about a cupful of the beans and mash well with some of the
  bean liquid. (This can be done in a blender, of course.) Return mashed
  beans to pot, taste for seasoning, and serve steaming hot over freshly
  cooked white rice.

      4    Sprigs Of Dill
    1/4 ts Pepper
 
  Food writer Norene Gilletz has adapted her grandmother's chicken soup
  recipe for cooking by microwave. In a soup kettle, combine chicken and
  salted water. Bring to a boil. Skim surface. Add carrots, celery, onion,
  dill and pepper to the hot broth. Cover and simmer until meat is tender and
  vegetables are cooked -- about two hours. Strain and refrigerate. Remove
  the fat that congeals on top and discard. Serve soup with noodles or rice,
  cooked separately or in the strained broth. Microwave method: Gilletz
  prefers this method, because all the ingredients and can be added at once
  and there is no need to skim the broth. In a bowl, pour boiling water over
  chicken. Trim off excess fat. Place chicken in a five-quart microwave-safe
  casserole. Cut carrots and celery into chunks. Add to chicken along with
  onion, dill and seasonings. cover with water. To prevent boiling over, take
  care water remains 1 1/2 inches below top of the casserole. Cover casserole
  and microwave at high (100 %) power for 30 ~ 35 minutes or until soup is
  boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium power for 25 ~ 30 minutes. Let stand
  covered for 15 - 20 minutes. Strain soup. Serve as above. From The Gazette,

  *TIP  In high-altitude areas, food may cook slower, even though  * * it may
  boil vigorousl y.  For liquid mixtures such as soups,  * * you may need a
  larger container; also remove the cover if  * * it's boiling too hard. To
  compensate for low boiling temp-  * * eratures, increase the power level by
  one level or lengthen  * * cooking time. Liquids also tend to evaporate
  faster at high * * altitudes, so you may need to add more water or liquid.

  Take half a pound of Butter, put it into a Stew pan and set it on the Fire,
  and let all the Butter melt, and boil until it is done making a Noise; then
  have ready ten or a Dozen middling sized Onions, peeled and cut small,
  which throw into the Butter, and let them fry for a Quarter of an hour;
  then shake a little Flour and stir them round; shake your Pan and let them
  do a few minutes longer; when you must pour in a Quart or three Pints of
  boiling water; stir them round, and throw in a good piece of the upper
  Crust of the stalest Bread you have.  Season with Salt to your palate. Let
  it then stew or boil gently for ten Minutes observing to stir it often;
  after which take it off the Fire, and have ready yolks of two Eggs beaten
  fine in a Spoonfull of Vinegar, and then stir it gently and by Degrees into
  your Soup, mixing it well.  This is a delicious Dish.
  
  NOTE:  Indeed it is, and the substitution of beef stock for half of the

  serving with one of the garnishes. VARIATIONS: - substitute 1 c cooked
  brown rice for the buckwheat noodles - substitute or add other vegetables
  such as chopped green peppers, chopped water chestnut, chopped jicama root,
  shredded spinach, chopped celery, or bamboo shoots. - to shorten prep time,
  use only 2 vegetables- onion and peas - for a "hotter" soup, subst. 1/2-1 t
  dry crushed red pepper - stir in 1 t toasted Sesame Oil or 1/2 t Chinese
  hot oil just before serving - for additional protein and flavor, stir Egg
  Threads into soup just before serving EGG THREADS: In a small skillet, heat
  a little margarine. When it begins to bubble, add 1 egg beaten with a
  little cold water. Tilt the pan so the yolk mixture coats it in a thin
  layer, the thinner the better. When the egg is lightly cooked, turn it out

      Title: Papa Joe's Cucumber and Red Onion Soup
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  6
 
      5 c  Cucumbers
      3 c  Red onions
      6 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Salt
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Fresh dill weed- chopped
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
 
  This is from Alice Brock at Alice's Restaurant.  Yes, THAT one.
  
  Peel and slice cucumbers as thin as you can.  Peel and slice red onions
  thin as you can.  (It's easier if you cut the onion in half and slice cut
  side down)
  
  Use a deep 1 gallon bowl or crock.  Alternate layers of cukes and onions
  with sprinkles of the salt and sugar between each layer.  This will draw
  out the juices that make it soup.  Pile sour cream on top.  DO NOT STIR.
  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours or more.
  
  To serve, add the fresh dill weed and lemon juice and stir it up. Add more
  lemon juice or sugar to taste.
  
  Cool and refreshing, this is just perfect when it is too hot to cook, and
  cucumbers are running wild.

      Title: Parsnip Chowder with Squash
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
   Servings:  6
 
      1 lb Parsnips
      1 lb Butternut squash or sweet
           -potatoes
      4    Strips bacon
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2    Stalks celery, finely
           -chopped
      3 tb Flour
      5 c  Chicken stock
           Bouquet garni of bay leaf,
           -thyme and parsley
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1 c  Heavy cream
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
           Cayenne pepper
           Freshly grated nutmeg
      3 tb Chopped fresh chives
 
  "Chowder originated as fish stew.  But in areas where seafood was
  unavailable, resourceful Americans used vegetables.  This recipe comes
  from....Rich Spencer, a chef in the Mount Washington Valley."
  
  Peel the parsnips and squash (or sweet potatoes) and cut each into 1/4 inch
  dice.  Cut the bacon into 1/4-inch strips and render it in a large
  saucepan.  When the bacon pieces are lightly browned, transfer with a
  slotted spoon to paper towels to dry.  Discard all but 3 tablespoons af the
  rendered fat.
  
  Add the onion and celery to the pan and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4
  minutes, until soft but not browned.  Stir in the flour and cook for 1
  minute to make a roux.  Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to a boil: the
  mixture will thicken slightly.
  
  Add the bouquet garni, cinnamon stick, parsnips and squash.  Simmer the
  chowder for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not
  soft.  Stir in the cream, salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg.  Just before
  serving, remove the bouquet garni and cinnamon stick.  Ladle the chowder
  into bowls and sprinkle each with chopped chives and nutmeg.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
   Servings:  6
 
      4 tb Butter
      7 c  Water
      3 md Leeks; the white parts only
           - chopped or cut
           - into 1/4-inch rounds
      6 c  Loosely packed sorrel leaves
           -the stems removed and
           - leaves roughly chopped
    1/2 ts Salt (to taste)
  1 1/2 lb Red potatoes; quartered
           - lengthwise & thinly sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
           Creme fraiche
      1 tb Chives
           - thinly sliced or snipped
 
  This is a rather rustic soup. For a more refined version, pass it through a
  food mill before serving.
  
  MELT THE BUTTER IN A SOUP POT and add 1/2 cup water. Add the leeks, sorrel
  and salt, then cook gently, covered, for 5 minutes over medium-low heat.
  Add the potatoes and cook another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, then
  pour in the rest of the water and gradually bring the soup to a boil. Lower
  the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Once
  the potatoes are soft, help break them down by pressing them against the
  side of the pan, making the soup as rough or smooth as you like. Or, if you
  prefer, pass the soup through a food mill. Taste the soup for salt and add
  more, if necessary. Serve with freshly ground pepper, a spoonful of creme
  fraiche swirled in and a delicate sprinkling of chives over the top. If
  you've got garden chives and they're in bloom, separate the individual
  flowers at the base and sprinkle on a few along with the green stems.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetables

      1    Text Only
 
  Get out a pot about the size of the amount of soup you want to make. Fill
  it about 1/2 full of water.  Peel and dice potatoes into bite size chunks,
  about 1 medium size per person.  Put them into the water.  Dice a medium
  size onion, add to the pot.  Peel a couple of carrots, slice then thin to
  cook in about the same amount of time as the potatoes. Bring to boil on the
  stove, turn down and simmer.  Season with salt and pepper to taste. (Lots
  of pepper, for my taste).  When the potatoes and carrots are soft, add 1
  can of evaporated skim milk.  I do not thicken the soup with anything, but
  I do cook the potatoes till they are quite done. I put diced cheese into
  the bowls, ladle the hot soup into the bowls.  If you used a low fat
  cheese, you could do this too, or you can skip the cheese. Also, to make a
  more filling soup, I add "rivells" to my soup (for a low fat soup, you
  would have to use egg substitute).  Take 1 or 2 eggs, beaten slightly, add
  1 half eggshell full of milk, and salt to taste, then flour to make a
  fairly stiff dough, drop little bits of this from a fork into the boiling
  soup.  If you add the rivells just after the soup boils, they will be done
  when the potatoes are done, proceed with the evaporated milk, etc. The
  above soup would have no fat, (except the rivells version) till you add the
  cheese.  Oh, yes, if I have celery, I throw in a stalk or two diced with
  the onion and carrot.  You can't make anything any simplier.

      Title: Potato Soup with Kale and Bacon
 Categories: Potatoes, Soups
   Servings:  4
 
      2 lb Boiling potatoes
    3/4 lb Bacon
      1 bn Kale (about 1 pound)
      1    Clove garlic
           Salt and pepper
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 bn Chives (optional)
      5 ts Balsamic vinegar
 
  Peel the potatoes and put in a pot with enough cold, salted water to cover.
  Cover and bring to a boil.  Lower heat, uncover, and simmer until done,
  about 25 minutes.  Drain, reserving the cooking liquid.  Break up potatoes
  with a potato masher; they should be lumpy, not smooth.
  
  Cook the bacon until crisp.  Drain and chop.  Pour off all but 2
  tablespoons of the bacon fat, reserving the extra fat.
  
  Stem and chop the kale.  Mince the garlic.  Cook half the kale and half the
  garlic in the 2 tablespoons bacon fat over medium heat until kale is
  wilted, about 1 minute.  Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a
  bowl.  Repeat with remaining kale and garlic, using the reserved bacon fat
  as needed.  Return all the kale to the frying pan and add the heavy cream.
  Simmer over low heat until the kale is tender, about 10 minutes. Mince the
  chives.  (Recipe can be made to this point several hours ahead.)
  
  Cooking and Serving:  Combine potatoes with about 4 cups of the reserved
  cooking liquid in a large pot.  Add more cooking liquid or water if too
  thick.  Add kale mixture to the pot and bring to a simmer.  Season to taste
  with salt and pepper.  Pour into bowls and sprinkle with chives and bacon.
  
  Yield: 4 servings.

      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      3    Baking potatoes (about 10
           -ounces each),
           Peeled and cut into 1/4-inch
           -slices
      6 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 ts Celery seed
 
  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper Buttermilk or extra broth, if
  desired
  
  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in onion and
  cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
  Add potato slices and broth; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat
  and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes until potatoes are
  almost cooked through.  Add celery seed and cook for 5 minutes more,
  stirring frequently to break up the potato slices.  Whisk gently with a
  baloon whisk until soup becomes smoother, but small pieces of potato should
  remain.  Season with salt and pepper.  If not serving immediately, you
  might want to add a little buttermilk or extra chicken broth because soup
  will get thicker as it stands.
  
  Makes six 1-cup servings.

      Title: Rhode Island Red Chowder
 Categories: Soups, Clams
   Servings:  8
 
     16 lg Qauhogs (2 cups chopped
           -meat)
      2 c  Dry white wine
      2    To 3 cups bottled clam broth
           -(or fish stock)
    1/4 lb Salt pork
      1 lg Onion
      2    Stalks celery
      2    Cloves garlic
      1 bn Flat leaf (Italian) parsley
      2    Bay leaves
      2    Sprigs fresh thyme
      4    Ripe tomatoes
      1 tb Tomato puree
      2 lg Potatoes
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Cayenne pepper
 
  Here is how Boston chef William Poirer makes red chowder, and it is good
  enough to convert the most diehard white chowder fanatic.
  
  Scrub the qauhogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the wine.
  Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open. Shuck the
  quahogs and grind, using a meat grinder or food processor. Strain the
  cooking liquid through damp cheesecloth - you should have 6 cups. If
  necessary, add clam broth or fish stock to make up the difference.
  
  Finely dice the salt pork.  Fry the salt pork slowly in a large pot over
  low heat to render the fat.  Transfer the cracklings with a slotted spoon
  to a paper towel to drain.  Meanwhile, finely chop the onion and celery.
  Mince the garlic.  Tie half of the parsley and the other herbs into a
  bouquet garni.  Finely chop the remaining parsley.  Peel, seed and coarsely
  chop the tomatoes.  Peel and dice the potatoes into a bowl of cold water to
  prevent them from browning.
  
  Saute the onions, celery, garlic and bouquet garni in the rendered fat over
  medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not browned. Add the
  tomatoes and tomato paste, increase the heat to high, and cook for 1
  minute.  Add the 6 cups of clam liquid and bring to a boil.  Add the
  potatoes, reduce the heat, and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender.
  
  Just before serving, stir in the quahog meat and salt and pepper to taste.
  Garnish the chowder with the chopped parsley and the salt pork cracklings
  and serve at once.
  
  Serves 8.

      Title: Roasted Garlic Soup
 Categories: Soups, Entertain
   Servings:  4
 
      4    Garlic heads; (about 1/2 po
           -und total), unpeeled
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      6 tb Unsalted butter; (3/4 stick
           -)
      4    Leeks; (white part only), c
           -hopped
      1    Onion; diced
      6 tb Flour; all purpose
      4 c  Chicken stock or canned brot
           -h; heated
    1/3 c  Sherry; dry
      1 c  Whipping cream
           Fresh lemon juice
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
      2 tb Chives; chopped fresh
 
       Preheat oven to 350F (or, if in a hurry, prepare roasted garlic in the
  microwave [see recipe]). Cut off top 1/4 inch of each garlic head. Place
  garlic heads in small shallow baking dish.  Drizzle oil over. Bake until
  golden, about 1 hour. Cool slightly. (I now wrap the heads with oil on top
  of them in aluminum foil so they don't brown as much.)
      Press individual garlic cloves between thumb and finger to release
  garlic.  Chop garlic.  Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium
  heat.  Add garlic, leeks and onion and saute until onion is translucent,
  about 8 minutes.  Reduce heat to low. Add flour and cook 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally.  Stir in hot stock and Sherry. Simmer 20 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Puree soup in batches in blender or
  processor. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)
      Return soup to saucepan.  Add cream and simmer until thickened, about
  10 minutes.  Add lemon juice to taste.  Season with salt and white pepper.
  Ladle into bowls.  Garnish with chives. Serves 4. This Roasted Garlic Soup
  is one we prefer to Susan Spicer's Garlic Soup; Spicer's relies on sauteed
  garlic and too often (even at Bayona) it comes out bitter. If you love
  garlic, you'll adore this soup.

      2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
      1 c  Barley
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  salt and pepper to taste
  
  In a large saucepan, saute onions and garlic in vegetable oil.  In a small
  frying pan, cook bacon, drain off fat and cut bacon into small pieces. (To
  save a step, I cut the bacon into bite size chunks first and then cook them
  in the same pot that the soup is going to be in.  Gives it a bit more
  flavour. Just drain off excess fat.)  To the saucepans,add bacon, celery,
  carrots, beef stock and tomato juice; cook until vegetables are just
  tender, about 10 minutes. Add the rest of the ingredients and cook until
  barley is tender, about 20-30 minutes. Serves 6-8.

  Last night I made soup.  My version of a type of minestrone.  I got a
  package of Knorr Vegetable soup mix, put 8 cups of water and 1 can of low
  sodium beef broth, defatted, brought this to a boil, then added a sliced
  leek, 1/4 head of sliced cabbage, 1 stalk of sliced celery, some alfalfa
  sprouts, 2/3 cups each of barley and small shell macaroni, a little
  oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme and some pepper.  Simmered it for about 2
  hours.  It made the best, THICK, vegetable soup!  I have a huge bowl in the
  freezer, and two big containers in the fridge for lunches this week.

      3 lg Onions,chopped
      1 sm Red or green bell pepper,

           Sour cream
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  Lentils were eaten long before Rome was founded; it is generally thought
  that the pottage for which Esau sold his birthright to Jacob (Genesis 25)
  was a stew of lentils. Sidney Taylor offers a better deal; you can have his
  recipe for lentils and keep your birthright. And we may assume that his
  lentil bisque is smoother. Jacob had no blender.
  
  ===========================================================================
  
  In an 8-10 quart pan, combine broth, celery, carrots, chopped onions, bell
  pepper, zucchini, and lentils. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover
  and simmer until lentils are very soft to bite, 50-55 minutes.
  
  Whirl mixture, a portion at a time, in a blender or food processor until
  smooth. Return to pan and stir in dry sherry and cream sherry. (If made
  ahead, or if there are no leftovers, cover and chill up to 4 days; or
  freeze in 2- or 3-serving portions.) Heat until steaming and ladle onto
  bowls. Add green onion, sour cream, and salt and pepper to taste.

    1/2    Scotch bonnet or other hot

      4    Shallots
      2    Cloves garlic
      3    Scallions
      1    Inch fresh ginger
      1    Red bell pepper
      1    Green bell pepper
      3 tb Butter
      2    To 3 tsp curry powder
      6 c  Fish stock or bottled clam
           -broth
      2 c  Coconut milk
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh cilantro for
           -garnish
 
  "This recipe was loosely inspired by a dish at the retaurant Al Forno in
  Providence, R.I.  Curry powder, cilantro and scotch bonnet chilies lend the
  chowder a West Indian accent.  (Scotch bonnet are the world's hottest
  chilies -- look for them at Caribbean markets.  Or substitute a milder
  chili, such as serrano or jalapeno.)  Be sure to use unsweetened coconut
  milk, which can be found canned in Indian, Southeast Asian, and Hispanic
  markets."
  
  Peel and devein the shrimp and cut into 1 inch pieces.  Remove the
  crescent-shaped muscle on the side of the scallops.  Cut large scallops in
  quarters, medium size ones in half, so that all are the same size. Mince
  the chili, shallots, garlic, scallions and ginger.  Core, seed, and dice
  the peppers.
  
  Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Cook the minced and diced vegetables
  over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not browned. Add the
  curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.  Add the fish stock and
  coconut milk and gently simmer for 5 minutes.
  
  Just before serving, add the shrimp and scallops.  Gently simmer for 2 to 3
  minutes until the shellfish is firm.  Correct the seasoning, adding salt,
  pepper and curry powder to taste.  To serve, ladle the chowder into bowls
  and garnish each with chopped cilantro.
  
  Serves 8 to 10.

  Cactus looks forbidding. Stripped of its prickly points, however, it is a
  mild-mannered vegetable with a slightly tart flavor. Look for easy-to-use
  canned cactus (sold as NOPALES or NOPALITOS) in supermarkets and Mexican
  groceries.

  is golden, about 15 minutes. Add tomatillos; stir often just until soft,
  about 6 minutes. Add broth; bring to a boil over high heat. Stir in cactus,
  lime juice, and cilantro. Cook until hot. Ladle soup into a tureen. Offer
  cheese to add to taste. Accompany with lime wedges.

  Quick-cooking dried peas and beans do not *require* overnight soaking. Some
  people, however, believe even those are *better* for soaking. Others prefer
  the old-fashioned type.  If you prefer to soak beans or peas, measure the
  amount of water specified in these recipes. Leave the beans or peas in it
  overnight.  Next morning, add the remaining ingredients.  No draining is
  necessary.
  
  Bring slowly to boiling point.  Cover and simmer 4 to 5 hours until beans
  or peas are tender and the liquid partially cooked down.  For smooth soup,
  rub through a coarse sieve.  Some prefer leaving some of the beans or peas
  whole.  Skim off excess fat.
  
  Thicken, if desired, with:
  
  3 Tablespoons butter 3 Tablespoons flour
  
  Dilute as desired with:

           -cups)
      2    Sprigs epazote, finely
           -chopped (Optional) *
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Toasted ** dry oregano
    1/2 lg White onion, sliced
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Roma tomatoes
      2    Cloves roasted *** garlic
      2 tb Pureed chipotles in adobo
           -(see recipe)
      2    Pasilla de Oaxaca chilies
           -(or anchos or mulatos),
           Stemmed
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      3 oz Monterey Jack cheese cut
           -into 4 slices.
 
  "This soup's hearty nature is appropriate, given the legendary fierceness
  of the Tarascan Indians of Michoacan, with whom the dish originated. The
  Tarascan civilization of the 14 th and 15th centuries was one of the few
  that was never conquered by the Aztecs, and was one of the last in Mexico
  to fall to the Spanish conquistadores.
  
  * This herb might be found at Hispanic markets. ** Toast oregano by quickly
  stirring it in a hot, dry skillet for about 1 minute. *** Roast the garlic
  by wrapping it in foil and slowly baking it in a 300 F oven for about 25
  minutes.
  
  Place the beans in a saucepan with the epazote, salt and oregano. Add
  enough water to cover the beans.  Cover the pan and bring to a boil. Reduce
  to a simmer, and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until the beans are soft,
  stirring occasionally.  Add more water as necessary.
  
  Saute the onions briefly in the olive oil.  Cut the tomatoes in half and
  remove the seeds.  Place the tomato halves on a baking sheet and roast in a
  350 F oven for 45 minutes (this intensifies their flavor). Transfer the
  tomatoes to a blender, add the cooked beans, onions and chipotle puree, and
  blend.  Add a little water if it seems too thick. Put the pureed mixture
  through a medium-mesh or fine-mesh sieve or pass it through a food mill, to
  remove seeds and skins.
  
  Transfer the soup to a saucepan and heat over low heat.  Meanwhile, lightly
  fry the chilies in the peanut oil for a few seconds, just until softened,
  and then cut into strips.  Add the slices of cheese and the chili strips to
  the soup and season with salt to taste.  When the cheese has melted, ladle
  the soup into bowls and serve.

      2 ts Cumin
           Salt to taste (Optional)
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
           JALAPENO CREAM:
    2/3 c  Plain nonfat or low-fat
           -yogurt
      1    Or 2 fresh jalapenos OR
           -pickled jalapenos, seeded
           -and
           Minced
      3 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1 tb Minced fresh cilantro
           -(Optional)
           GARNISHES (Optional):
    1/2 c  Chopped red onion
    1/2    Avocado, peeled, seeded, and
           -chopped
 
  SOUP:
  
  Drain the beans and put them in a large, heavy pot.  Add the broth and
  water.  Bring the beans to a boil, stirring them a few times, reduce the
  heat, and simmer the beans in the uncovered pot for 1 hour.
  
  Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the cumin, and continue simmering
  the beans for 2 hours or until the beans are soft (check after 1 and 1 1/2
  hours, since the timing depends on the dryness or age of the beans.)
  
  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and let the mixture cool briefly.
  Rinse out the pot.  Then puree the mixture in batches in a blender or food
  processor until the mixture is smooth, returning the puree to the pot as
  you go.
  
  Season the soup with the salt (if desired) and pepper, and bring the soup
  to a simmer.  If the soup is too thin, simmer it in the uncovered pot,
  stirring it often, until the desired consistency is reached.
  
  To prepare jalapeno cream, whisk together the yogurt, jalapenos, parsley,
  and, if you are using it, cilantro.  Serve a dollop of the jalapeno cream
  atop each bowl of soup.  If you wish, you may also garnish the soup with
  the chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.
  
  PREPARATION TIPS:  You can prepare the soup up to 4 days in advance and
  store it, covered, in the refrigerator.  Or you can freeze it.  The
  jalapeno cream can be prepared 1 or 2 days ahead.
  
  SERVING SUGGESTIONS:  In addition to the jalapeno cream, try garnishing the
  soup with chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.  With bread and salad,
  this soup could be the base for a light lunch.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 main or 8 to 10 first-course servings.

      1 lg Strip orange zest (2" long)
      2    Bay leaves
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Chopped parsley
     12    Nicoise olives, pitted; -OR-
           - Gaeta or oil-cured
           - Black olives, pitted
 
  PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if large,
  into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're scarred, and
  cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave some of the core so
  that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes into large, neat pieces.
  Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to taste and the potatoes, and
  boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes, but save the water. While the
  potatoes are cooking, warm the olive oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the
  leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay
  leaves. Cook slowly over medium heat until the onions have begun to soften,
  after 6 or 7 minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately
  half, then add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
  parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water to
  cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can set the
  stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top of the stove.
  If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook slowly until the
  vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking in the oven, preheat it
  to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1 hour, or until done. Remove bay
  leaves. Garnish with the remaining parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic
  mayonnaise.

  No, here, with the Tex-Mex influence, they're very big on tortilla soup,
  which is a chicken-based soup that has tortilla chips or sliced, fried
  tortilla strips on top.  If it's made well, it's wonderful.  However, I've
  had some that tastes like soap.  Here are some recipes that I haven't
  tried, so I can't vouch for them.  They are from pretty trust- worthy
  sources, though.  Let me know what you think.  If they don't do the trick,
  I'm sure I can hunt down some more.
  
  Number of Servings:   6 Approx. Cook Time: 0:40
  
  Chop onion and celery.  Mince garlic.  Saute onion, celery and garlic in
  oil until tender.  Add all the remaining ingredients except the tortillas,
  cheese, and cilantro (which is optional). Simmer 30 minutes.  Cut tortillas
  into strips and simmer 2 minutes. Ladle into bowls and top with cheese.
  Other options are to top with avocado, cilantro, and a dollop of sour
  cream. From _Flavors of Simon David_, March 1991

           Chopped
      1 cn (12 oz) no salt green
           Beans, drained

           Any peels, root ends and
           Leafy tops left over from -
           Onions, celery, potatoes,
           Carrots
           Several bruised garlic
           Cloves

      1 cn (12 oz) no salt corn,
           Drained
      1 lg White onion, chopped
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
    Cut wings off carcass and cut up the remaining bird as you would a
  chicken for frying.  Place the carcass pieces and any left over peelings &
  parings into a stock pot and fill with water.  Add garlic cloves.  Fill the
  stock pot with water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let
  it cook until the liquid is reduced by 1/3.  Remove from heat to cool cover
  and refrigerate overnight.  The next day remove the congealed fat from the
  top of the broth.  Drain the contents through a collander into another
  large pot.  Return the broth to the stock pot.  Go through the collander
  and remove vegetable & garlic pieces and discard.  Next, go through the
  turkey remnants and pull out all the meat and add to the stock pot. Add any
  left over vegetables, carrots, celery, corn, green beans and the onion to
  the pot.  There should be *just* enough liquid to cover the contents. Place
  over heat and bring to a boil.  While you're waiting, cook the egg noodles
  per package directions and drain.  Simmer the soup just long enough to cook
  the carrots.  Add 2 quarts of water, egg noodles and left over gravy.
  Adjust seasonings (salt & pepper).  Stir well, let simmer long enough to
  heat noodles and serve.
  
  Makes a bunch!

  part.  Cover with water and add salt.  Cook until meat freely separates
  from bones.  Remove drainer and put into a pan to catch the remainder of
  the liquid.  When cool enough, remove the meat from the bones and put back
  into the broth.  Let cool and put into refrigerator until fat on top
  solidifies.  Remove fat.  Reheat to a simmer and add remainder of
  ingredients.  Cook until lima beans are quite tender. Adjust seasoning to

  * Use wathever you like from spices and herbs. I usually add some "taco
  table spicemix", some oregano and some black pepper.
  
  Bring the water to a boil together with the meat extract cubes. Add
  vegetables and tomato juice. Add more water, put the water into the tomato
  juice packet and shake so you get all of the juice out of it. Let simmer
  until everything get really mixed and you can't really see what is what.
  Mix a little water with flour, add, stir well and let boil for a couple of
  minutes.
  
  These are pretty large servings, and noone has to be hungry after eating...
  You can replace almost all the vegetables with something else, it should be
  a total of about 800 g vegetables, that's the main "rule" in this recipe...
  
  If you are a Weight Watcher one portion will take about 10 extra calories
  from your weekly amount of extra calories , NOTHING ELSE... guess if I love
  this recipe!

      Title: Vegetable Stock
 Categories: Vegetables, Soups, Vegetarian
   Servings:  6
 
      2 lg Unpeeled potatoes,
           -quartered
      2 lg Carrots, peeled and
           -sliced thickly
      1 lg Onion, peeled and
           -quartered
      1    Celery stalk, chopped
      1    Apple or pear, seeded and
           -quartered
      1    Bay leaf
     12    Peppercorns
     10 c  Water (2 1/2 qts)
 
  Yields 2 quarts.
  
  Vegetable Stock is a broth made by simmering vegetables in water until they
  are soft and their flavors and nutrients have been released into the
  liquid.  Then the stock is poured through a strainer and the vegetables are
  either discarded or used, pureed, to thicken a soup.
  
  The best vegetables to use in stock are carrots, peeled onions, celery,
  zucchini, potatoes and squash.  We often throw in chunks of apples or pears
  to sweeten the stock a little - especially if the carrots we're using
  aren't very sweet.  It's wise to avoid the strongly flavored vegetables of
  the cabbage family, such as broccoli and cauliflower, and turnips,
  rutabagas and kohlrabi - and vegetables with bleeding colors, such as
  beets, red cabbage and greens (unless you intend to make a borscht or cream
  of greens soup).  Green peppers and eggplant will make the stock bitter. Be
  cautious about adding lots of tomatoes or other acidic fruits or vegetables
  to the stock, because they may curdle the soup if you add milk or other
  dairy products later on.
  
  Wash all vegetables thoroughly, especially root vegetables.  Making stock
  is the perfect solution for vegetables that are too unattractive
  cosmeticallly to be used in other ways.  Leftover carrot sticks, parsley
  stems, and unused halves of onion can all be tossed into the pot.
  
  Put all of the ingredients into a large pot, bring to a boil, and simmer
  for 45 minutes to an hour.  Strain and use.
  
  For a spicier stock throw in some garlic cloves, skins and all, and a small
  amount of tomato.  For a specifically Asian broth, add ginger, scallions
  and shiitake mushrooms.  Or, make it sweet for a carrot puree or
  Scandinavian fruit soup with the addition of sweet potato or winter squash.

  A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:
  
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways of
  preparing dry beans for cooking.  All start with a thorough inspection for
  damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in cold water.  The next
  step, which is highly recommended, is soaking the beans.  This not only
  helps make the beans cook faster, it also improves flavor, texture,
  appearance and digestibility.  For maximum improvement of these factors, it
  is recommended that the soak water be discarded and the beans rinsed and
  cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so be sure
  to start with a large enough pot.  (Note:  up to 2 teaspoons of salt per
  pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.)
  Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover and
  set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak method), but *preferably* four
  hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater
  amount of the gas-causing properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping
  the beans to be more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects.
  Whether you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to
  DISCARD THE SOAK WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt.  Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness is
  reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons onion salt
  and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Add 1 Tablespoon
  chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker helps,
  but follow manufacturer's directions.  [Personal note:  Tom says 1/2 hour
  in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to cooking them
  overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure cooker, as they
  expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or kidney
  beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings, lard, oil,
  butter or margarine.

      In a saucepan over moderately low heat, melt butter and stir in the
  onions.  Cover and cook slowly until the onions are transparent. Blend in
  the flour. Stir slowly for 3 minutes, to cook the flour without letting it
  color.  Remove from heat and, when bubbling stops, pour in 1 cup of hot
  liquid all a once, whisking vigorously to blend smoothly. Whisk in 6 more
  cups. Bring to a simmer, stirring, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
  frequently.
      The soup base should coat a spoon lightly; add dollops of more liquid
  if too thick. Correct seasoning, and continue as your recipes directs.
  
  Makes about 2 quarts.
  
  Suggestion:  Use with Upperline's Ancho Crab Soup or Flagon's Cream of
  Mushroom and Brie Soup.

  5 1/2 lb Lean venison, cut into 1
           -1/4-inch cubes
      5 oz Lard
  5 1/2 lb Onions, sliced
      5 oz Sweet paprika
      1 tb Hot paprika
  1 1/4 qt Red wine
  3 1/8 qt Water
      2 lg Potatoes, peeled and
           -quartered
      3    Carrots, peeled and
           -quartered
      2    Apples, peeled, cored and
           -quartered
           Peppercorns
           Juniper berries
      3    Bay leaves
           A few "Piment" seeds (??)
      3    Stalks celery, thinly sliced
      2 bn Parsley, chopped
           Sour cream to taste
 
  Best made in large quantities.  Recipe therefor serves 12.
  
  In a large pot, melt some of the lard and brown the meat in batches. Add
  more lard as required.  Remove the meat and reserve.  Fry onions until
  browned.  Remove onions from pot and reserve.  Add remaining lard. Add
  paprika and stir well.  Slowly add red wine and water, continuing to stir
  to make sure there are no lumps of paprika.  Add meat and onions to pot
  again.  Add potatoes, carrots, apples and spices.  Quantities are
  approximate, use more, or less, as you wish.  Cook gently, covered, for 3
  hours.  Check occasionally, and add more water as required.  Remove coarse
  spices, and add celery and parsley.  Serve with a bowl of sour cream, so
  each person can help themselves.
  
  NOTE:  This recipe does not mention salt, or pepper, which in my opinion
  ought to be included.

      Title: Venison Savory Stew
 Categories: Soups
   Servings:  8
 
      2 lb Venison Roast (Boneless)
    1/2 c  White Wine
    1/8 c  Worcestershire Sauce
      1 c  Lentils
      1 lg Cucumber, Diced
      1    Jalepeno Pepper, Diced
      6 md Bannana Peppers, Chopped
      4 sm Potatoes, Quartered
      1    Box Of Fiber One
      1 pk Top Ramen Beef Fl. Noodles
      4    Triscuit Snack Crackers
    1/4 pk Ranch Dip Mix (Sour Cream)
 
  Do not skin, peel, or otherwise denude the vegetables or potatoes.  Wash
  them briskly and then cut them up.  The good stuff is in the skin, always,
  as the skin is what was intended to serve, protect and defend the pulp and
  seeds. Fill large crock pot half full of clean cold water. Add ingredients.
  Let cook on low heat for 12-16 hours. Season as desired during last 1 hour
  of cooking, adding bay, etc., as suits your individual collection of buds.
  This recipe may be done with any game animal, except that squirrel tends to
  be far too stringy for my taste.  If you like hearty and thick, this stew
  is for you.  It would also go well with beef, obviously. I do recommend a
  bay leaf added to the top for the last hour.

  A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:
  
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways of
  preparing dry beans for cooking.  All start with a thorough inspection for
  damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in cold water.  The next
  step, which is highly recommended, is soaking the beans.  This not only
  helps make the beans cook faster, it also improves flavor, texture,
  appearance and digestibility.  For maximum improvement of these factors, it
  is recommended that the soak water be discarded and the beans rinsed and
  cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so be sure
  to start with a large enough pot.  (Note:  up to 2 teaspoons of salt per
  pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water more evenly.)
  Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove from heat, cover and
  set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak method), but *preferably* four
  hours or more.  The longer soaking time is recommended to allow a greater
  amount of the gas-causing properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping
  the beans to be more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects.
  Whether you soak the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to
  DISCARD THE SOAK WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt.  Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness is
  reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons onion salt
  and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Add 1 Tablespoon
  chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker helps,
  but follow manufacturer's directions.  [Personal note:  Tom says 1/2 hour
  in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to cooking them
  overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure cooker, as they
  expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or kidney
  beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings, lard, oil,
  butter or margarine.

      Title: White and Green Bean Soup
 Categories: Soups, Beans
   Servings:  6
 
  1 1/2 c  Dried white beans, Great
           -Northern, navy, or baby
           -lima
      6 c  Water
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      2 ts Salt
      4 c  Beef broth
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Rosemary, crumbled
      2 c  Fresh green beans (about 3/4
           -lb), cut on the
           Diagonal in 1-inch pieces
      1 tb Butter
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
 
  Wash and pick over the dried beans.  Put them into a large saucepan or
  kettle with the water and bring to a boil.  Remove from the heat, cover,
  and allow to stand for 1 hour.
  
  Return to the heat and bring to a boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer,
  partially covered, for 1/2 hour.  Using a heavy fork, mash the garlic with
  the salt until no large chunks remain.  Add to the saucepan with the beans.
  Add the broth, pepper, and rosemary.
  
  Simmer, partially covered, until beans are tender.  This can take 15
  minutes or as long as 1 hour; timing for beans is hard to predict - keep
  checking.
  
  Soup can be made ahead to this point, and refrigerated or frozen after
  thorough cooling.
  
  Cook the green beans uncovered in 2 uarts of boiling salted water until
  they are tender-crisp and bright green.  Drain and add to the soup when the
  white beans are tender but not mushy. If green beans are not to be added
  right away, rinse in cold water to retain color.  Stir in the butter and
  lemon.  Serve at once, while green beans are still bright.
  
  Note:  If you want some of the soup pureed, do it before adding the green
  beans - the color will be better.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

    3/4 lb Dried cannelloni or navy
           -beans, rinsed,
           Picked over, and soaked
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary (or 2
           -teaspoons dried)
      2 tb Chopped fresh rosemary (or 2
           -teaspoons dried)
      8 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
           Salt, to taste
 
  Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion, carrot,
  celery, garlic, and ham; saute, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.  Add
  the beans, rosemary, chicken stock, and pepper; bring to a boil.  Cover and
  simmer for 30 minutes.  Taste the cooking liquid, and add enough salt so
  that it becomes slightly salty (the amount needed will vary depending on
  the type of ham used for seasoning).
  
  Recover the pot and simmer for an additional 40 to 60 minutes, or until the
  beans are soft.
  
  Puree the mixture in a food processor fitted with the steel blade, or in a
  blender.  Serve hot.
  
  NOTE:  The soup can be made up to three days in advance and refrigerated,
  tightly covered.  It will probably thicken from the starch in the beans,
  and can be thinned to the desired consistency with some stock when it is
  reheated.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: White Clam Chowder with Leeks
 Categories: Soups, Clams
   Servings: 12
 
     24    Quahogs (3 cups chopped meat
           -and liquor)
      3 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  (Approx) fish stock, clam
           -broth or water
      6    Leeks, trimmed and washed
      2    Onions
      4    Stalks celery
      3 oz Salt pork
      6    Strips bacon
    1/3 c  Flour
      3 lg Potatoes, peeled and diced
           Bouquet garni of bay leaf,
           -thyme and parsley
           Salt, pepper and cayenne
           -pepper
      2 c  Peanut oil for frying the
           -leeks
      1 c  Heavy cream
      4 tb Finely chopped chives or
           -parsley
      3 tb Butter
 
  This chowder has two twists: bacon is added in addition to salt pork and
  fried julienned leeks are used as a garnish.  The recipe comes from Ris
  Lacoste, chef at 21 Federal St. in Washington.
  
  Scrub the quahogs and place them in a large, covered pot with the wine.
  Steam them for 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells just open. Shuck the
  quahogs and grind with a meat grinder or food processor. Strain the cooking
  liquid through damp cheesecloth - you should have 2 quarts. If you don'y,
  add fish stock, clam broth or water to make up the difference. Reserve the
  ground clams and the liquid separately.
  
  Finely chop three of the leeks.  Cut the remaining three leeks into fine
  julienne and reserve them for the garnish.  Finely chop the onion and
  celery.  Finely dice the salt pork and bacon.  Fry the salt pork and bacon
  in a large pot over medium heat to render the fat.  Remove the cracklings
  with a slotted spoon.  Discard all but 6 tablespoons of the fat.
  
  Add the chopped leeks, onion and celery to the pot and gently cook for 3 to
  4 minutes, or until soft.  Stir in the flour and cook over low heat for 3
  to 4 minutes.  Whisk in the reserved liquid and bouquet garni and gradually
  bring to a boil.  Add the potatoes and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
  tender.  Stir in the cream, ground quahogs, cracklings, and salt,pepper and
  cayenne to taste.
  
  Just before serving, heat the oil to 375F.  Fry the julienned leeks for 1
  minute until crisp.  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. To
  serve, ladle the chowder into bowls.  Place a pat of butter in each bowl
  and garnish with the fried leeks.
  
  Makes 12 servings.
